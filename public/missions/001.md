## Get Started
# Goals
- Pick your player by signing up.  It's Free.  [**Game of Politics**](https://blog.workdojos.com/game-of-politics)
- Read the e-mail we send you and get acquainted with your **dashboard.**
  - Customize your dashboard and familiarize yourself with the basics surrounding your player, his/her life, aspirations, and most importantly **PROGRESS** as your elected official.

# Stakes
- Your succuess is on the line.  Timing is critical because your elected official is not being held to account.  They need you, a **coach**, a **motivator,** a **savior,** and maybe one hell of a **political gamer.**

# Reserves
- None at this time.  You are on your own.  This is a hands-off unfiltered and uncensored battleground.  You might be our only hope.  Good luck!
