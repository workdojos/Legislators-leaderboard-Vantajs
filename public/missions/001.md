## Get Started
# Goals
- Pick your player by signing up.  It's Free.  [**Game of Politics**](https://blog.workdojos.com/game-of-politics)
- Read the e-mail we send you and get acquainted with your **dashboard.**
  - Customize your dashboard and familiarize yourself with the basics surrounding your player, his/her life, aspirations, accomplishments, challenges, and controversies.

# Stakes
- Your succuess is on the line and your candidate risks failure.  Timing is critical because your elected official is not being held to account.  They need you to fix things and they need your help. 

# Reserves
- None at this time.  You are on your own.  This is a hands-off unfiltered and uncensored battleground.  You might be our only hope.  Good luck!
