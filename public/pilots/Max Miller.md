Max Miller is a former aide to President Donald Trump and a Republican candidate for Congress in Ohio's 16th district. Before entering politics, Miller was a professional football player who played for the Cleveland Browns until injury ended his career. 

Miller has been endorsed by President Trump, who has called him a true patriot and a fighter for Ohio's values. Miller has emphasized his support for Trump's policies, including border security and tax reform.

Miller's campaign website outlines his stances on several key issues. He supports building a border wall, lowering taxes, and expanding Second Amendment rights. He also emphasizes his support for law enforcement and his opposition to radical leftist policies.

One potential point of controversy for Miller is his involvement in the January 6th Capitol riot. Miller attended the rally that preceded the riot and has been photographed wearing a Roger Stone Did Nothing Wrong shirt. Stone is a political operative and Trump ally who was convicted of witness tampering and other charges related to the Mueller investigation. While Miller has not been accused of participating in the riot itself, his attendance at the protest has raised questions about his judgment and his commitment to democracy.

Despite this controversy, Miller has been making inroads in his campaign for Congress. He has raised significant funds and gained endorsements from several prominent Republicans, including Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.

As the race for Ohio's 16th district heats up, voters will have an important decision to make about Max Miller. While his support for Trump and his conservative policies may appeal to many voters, his connection to the Capitol riot may raise concerns about his fitness for office. Regardless of the outcome, Miller's candidacy is sure to be closely watched as a sign of the Republican Party's direction in the post-Trump era.
