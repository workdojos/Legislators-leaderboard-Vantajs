Mark Green is a Republican politician who represents Tennessee's 7th Congressional district. He was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018 and was re-elected in 2020. Before entering politics, Green served in the U.S. Army for over 20 years, including as a Special Forces officer.

Green's political career has not been without controversy. In 2018, he was criticized for comments he made during a town hall meeting in which he suggested that vaccines may be linked to autism. He later walked back those comments and affirmed his support for vaccines.

On the issue of healthcare, Green has been a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act, calling it a disaster and supporting efforts to repeal and replace it. In Congress, he has also advocated for increased access to telehealth services, particularly in rural areas.

Green has been a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights, sponsoring legislation that would allow individuals with concealed carry permits to carry their firearms across state lines. He has also pushed for increased funding for mental health services to address gun violence.

Regarding the economy, Green has been a staunch supporter of small business and has advocated for lower taxes and less government regulation. He has also supported efforts to strengthen American manufacturing and reduce the trade deficit with countries like China.

Despite these controversies, Green has had some notable achievements in his political career to date. In 2020, he was named the American Conservative Union Foundation's Conservative Champion for scoring a perfect 100% on their legislative scorecard. He has also advocated for increased funding for medical research, particularly for rare diseases like ALS.

In a recent interview, Green stated, I want to be known as somebody that does the hard work, that's willing to stand up and fight for what's right, and that puts the district first. Only time will tell if Green will continue to make a name for himself in Congress and live up to that statement.
