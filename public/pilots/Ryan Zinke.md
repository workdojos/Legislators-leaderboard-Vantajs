Ryan Zinke is a former congressman and Navy SEAL from Montana who served as the 52nd Secretary of the Interior under President Donald Trump. He is known for his strong environmental views and advocacy for public lands.

During his time in Congress, Zinke received praise for his dedication to veterans' issues. He sponsored the Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act, which was signed into law by President Trump in 2017.

However, Zinke’s tenure as Secretary of the Interior was marked by controversy. He faced multiple ethics investigations, including allegations of improper use of taxpayer-funded travel and conflicts of interest related to his financial ties to energy companies. In 2018, he resigned from his position amid mounting criticism.

One of Zinke's most notable achievements is his support of the Great American Outdoors Act, which was signed into law in 2020. The act provides funding for public land conservation and maintenance, as well as funding for national parks and other outdoor recreational areas.

On environmental issues, Zinke has been a strong advocate for energy independence and has called for increased oil and gas exploration on public lands. He has also been a vocal critic of climate change science, stating in a 2014 interview that he does not believe it is “proven science.” 

Zinke has been quoted as saying, “Science should drive our decisions, and we need to make sure that science is not manipulated by politics or ideology.” This statement is in line with his support of the use of scientific research in making policy decisions.

In summary, Ryan Zinke is a former congressman and Secretary of the Interior who has been praised for his advocacy for veterans' issues and support of public land conservation. However, his tenure as Secretary was marked by controversy and his views on certain environmental issues may not align with some voters. Ultimately, prospective voters will need to weigh these factors when considering Zinke’s political record and positions on the issues.
