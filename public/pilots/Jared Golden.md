Jared Golden is a United States Representative for Maine’s 2nd congressional district, serving his second term in office after first being elected in 2018. He is a member of the Democratic Party and has been a prominent figure in Maine politics for over a decade.

Golden gained national attention during his first term in Congress for casting the decisive vote to impeach President Donald Trump in December 2019. He was one of only two Democrats from districts that Trump won in 2016 to vote in favor of impeachment, a move that demonstrated his commitment to upholding the rule of law and holding elected officials accountable for their actions.

Throughout his time in Congress, Golden has been a strong advocate for working-class families and rural communities. He has pushed for policies that would improve access to affordable healthcare, protect workers’ rights, and promote economic growth in underserved areas.

One of Golden's most notable achievements in Congress was his co-sponsorship of the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, which provided additional relief to small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. He has also worked to increase funding for healthcare providers and vaccine distribution in Maine.

In addition to his legislative work, Golden is an Afghanistan War veteran who served in the U.S. Marine Corps and was awarded the Bronze Star for his service. He has been vocal about the need to end the forever wars and to ensure that veterans receive the support and resources they need to transition back into civilian life.

Despite his accomplishments, Golden is not without controversy. He faced criticism from some progressive voters for his vote in favor of a defense spending bill in 2020, and he has been the subject of attack ads from Republican opponents who have attempted to paint him as a “radical” liberal.

On major issues, Golden has been a vocal advocate for climate action and has supported policies that would reduce carbon emissions and invest in renewable energy sources. He has also supported reproductive rights and has continually advocated for equal rights and protections for the LGBTQ+ community.

In conclusion, Jared Golden's commitment to accountability, economic justice, and the needs of working-class Americans have made him a prominent figure in Congress. While he has faced criticism for some of his decisions, his notable achievements and dedication to his constituents make him a viable candidate for future elections.
