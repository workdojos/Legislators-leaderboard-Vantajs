Elise Stefanik is a Republican Congresswoman for New York's 21st District who has been in office since 2015. She gained national attention during the 2019 impeachment hearings when she became one of President Trump's most vocal defenders.

Stefanik graduated from Harvard University with a degree in government and worked in the George W. Bush White House before running for Congress in 2014. She is the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.

Stefanik is known for her focus on national security and has served on the House Armed Services Committee. She has also been a strong advocate for small businesses and has supported policies to reduce regulations and lower taxes.

However, Stefanik has been criticized for her support of President Trump's baseless claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election. She was one of the 147 Republicans who voted to overturn the election results, and she faced backlash from her constituents and even some of her former supporters.

One of Stefanik's most notable accomplishments is the passage of the Broadband DATA Act, which aims to improve the accuracy of broadband mapping in rural areas. This was a bipartisan effort that has been praised by many as a crucial step towards expanding rural access to the internet.

Stefanik has also been praised for her unwavering commitment to supporting military families. She sponsored the Military Family Stability Act, which allows military families to delay permanent change of station orders if they have a child with special needs.

When asked about her political philosophy, Stefanik has said, I'm a pragmatic conservative who's focused on results. She has been endorsed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Rifle Association.

In terms of major issues, Stefanik is generally aligned with the Republican party. She opposes gun control measures and supports restrictions on abortion. She has been a vocal supporter of President Trump's border wall and supports reducing immigration.

While Stefanik has faced criticism for her controversial remarks and voting record, she has also gained support from conservatives who view her as a rising star in the Republican party. It will be interesting to see how she navigates future elections and whether she can balance her support for President Trump with the needs and concerns of her constituents.
