Mike Gallagher is a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives for Wisconsin's 8th congressional district. First elected in 2016, his voting record is conservative, and he has taken positions on various issues that appeal to his base and his party.

Gallagher served as a counterintelligence and general intelligence officer in the United States Marine Corps from 2006 to 2013. During this time, he earned multiple awards for his leadership and service, including the Navy Marine Corps Achievement Medal and the Iraq Campaign Medal.

Gallagher is a member of several influential committees in Congress, including the House Armed Services Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. He has been a vocal supporter of increased military spending and modernizing U.S. military capabilities, stating that our military is the most powerful fighting force in the world, but we must ensure that it stays that way.

In terms of domestic policy, Gallagher is a proponent of limited government and fiscal conservatism. He has voted in support of tax cuts for individuals and businesses, and has been a critic of wasteful government spending.

Gallagher has also been a critic of the Affordable Care Act, the landmark healthcare reform law passed in 2010. He has supported efforts to repeal the law and replace it with market-based solutions.

Notably, Gallagher has been critical of President Trump on several occasions. In a January 2021 op-ed for the Washington Post, he wrote that Trump had betrayed his oath of office and incited violence against our government, and called for his removal from office through the 25th Amendment or impeachment.

While Gallagher's dissent from Trump's views has made him a somewhat controversial figure within the Republican Party, he remains popular with his constituents in Wisconsin's 8th congressional district. In his 2020 reelection campaign, he won with over 63% of the vote.

Overall, Gallagher is a conservative voice in Congress with a background in the military and a commitment to limited government and fiscal responsibility. His willingness to break with his party on occasion may make him something of an outlier, but it also shows an independent streak that could appeal to voters of all political stripes.
