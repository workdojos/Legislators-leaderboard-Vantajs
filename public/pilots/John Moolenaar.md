John Moolenaar is a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Michigan's 4th congressional district. He has been serving since 2015 and is up for re-election in the upcoming 2022 midterms.

One of Moolenaar's major accomplishments in Congress has been securing funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a program aimed at protecting and restoring the Great Lakes ecosystem. In 2020, he secured $335 million in funding for the initiative, the largest amount ever secured by a member of Congress.

However, Moolenaar's voting record has been criticized by some for his stances on healthcare and climate change. He voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which provided healthcare coverage to millions of Americans, and has opposed efforts to combat climate change.

Moolenaar's stance on immigration has also been a topic of contention. He has supported building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and sponsored a bill that would end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which provides protection from deportation for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children.

In terms of notable quotes, Moolenaar has said: Agriculture is a critical part of Michigan's economy and our way of life, and As a father, I believe every child deserves a quality education that empowers them to succeed.

Overall, John Moolenaar's record in Congress shows a dedication to his constituents, particularly in the areas of agriculture and environmental preservation. However, his stances on healthcare, climate change, and immigration may be points of contention for some voters. It will be interesting to see how he performs in the upcoming midterm elections.
