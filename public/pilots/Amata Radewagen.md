Amata Radewagen is a Republican member of the US House of Representatives and has represented American Samoa's At-large congressional district since 2015. Radewagen, born on December 29, 1947, is the first woman to have ever represented American Samoa in the US Congress. 

Radewagen has a long-standing history of public service. Before her election to Congress, she served on the American Samoa Government’s Executive Branch, holding the position of Director of the Department of Commerce. Her political career also includes serving as American Samoa's Republican National Committeewoman from 1988 to 2013.

During her time in Congress, Radewagen has focused on issues like job creation, economic growth, and supporting small businesses. In 2017, she was appointed to the Committee on Natural Resources, which oversees federal lands and resource management, water and power, fisheries, wildlife conservation, Indian affairs, and territorial issues. 

Radewagen has been known to have a pro-business stance and has endorsed tax reform measures, deregulation policies, and incentives for job creation. In response to the Covid-19 pandemic, she supported the CARES Act to provide relief to American citizens amidst the economic crisis caused by the pandemic.

However, her views on important issues like healthcare, gun control, immigration, and climate change may not line up with all voters. Radewagen voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act ('Obamacare') in 2017 and supports concealed carry reciprocity to allow legal gun owners to carry their weapons across state lines. She has also been a critic of sanctuary cities and voted for strict immigration measures including restricting access to public education and healthcare for undocumented immigrants.

On the issue of climate change, Radewagen acknowledges its existence but has taken a moderate position, calling for balance between environmental protection and economic growth. In a 2019 House Natural Resources Committee hearing, she stated: Addressing climate change and protecting our environment is an important priority, while pursuing robust economic growth, and job creation.

Despite political differences, Radewagen has earned respect from colleagues on both sides of the aisle. Former President Donald Trump described her as a “fantastic leader” and her fellow Samoa descendant, Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz, commended her ability to put her politics aside for the benefit of American Samoa.

In conclusion, Amata Radewagen has displayed a commitment to public service and job creation, which has earned her respect among her peers. However, her stance on some of the significant issues facing the country may not align with all potential voters. As the 2022 midterms approach, prospective voters should consider these positions while evaluating her candidacy.
