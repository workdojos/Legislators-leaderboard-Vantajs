Jerry Carl is a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Alabama's 1st Congressional District. He was first elected to the position in 2020 with 65.4% of the vote. Prior to his election, Carl served as the president of the Mobile County Commission and owned his own construction company.

Carl has emphasized his commitment to conservative values throughout his political career, particularly in supporting pro-life policies and Second Amendment rights. He has also championed small businesses, advocating for reducing regulations and taxes to promote economic growth. In his first year in Congress, Carl sponsored eight bills related to veterans' issues, small business relief, and infrastructure improvements.

One of Carl's most notable achievements was his leadership in the construction of the Alabama Gulf Coast Zoo, which replaced the zoo that was destroyed during Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Under his guidance, the zoo was rebuilt and expanded, becoming a major tourist attraction and economic asset for the Gulf Coast region.

However, Carl has also faced criticism and controversy during his career. In 2018, he supported a controversial proposal to levy a fee on non-profits that provide food and other services to homeless individuals, which drew criticism from advocates for the homeless. Additionally, he has faced accusations of ethical violations related to his business interests and ties to developers.

Despite these criticisms, Carl remains a popular figure in Alabama politics and has retained strong support from the Republican Party. As he continues his tenure in Congress, it will be interesting to see how he approaches the major issues facing the country, including infrastructure, healthcare, and education.
