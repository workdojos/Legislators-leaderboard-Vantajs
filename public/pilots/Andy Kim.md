Andy Kim is a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives, representing New Jersey's 3rd congressional district. He was first elected in 2018, defeating Republican incumbent Tom MacArthur. Kim is a former diplomat and national security advisor who served under both President Obama and President Trump.

Over the course of his first term in Congress, Kim has been a vocal advocate for issues such as healthcare, gun control, and environmental protection. He has sponsored or co-sponsored several pieces of legislation related to these issues, including the Strengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Act and the Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act.

Kim has also been a prominent critic of President Trump's foreign policy, particularly his handling of North Korea. In 2019, Kim penned an op-ed in the New York Times calling for a new approach to diplomacy with North Korea, arguing that a sustained diplomatic effort with North Korea is the only viable path forward.

Kim's campaign in 2018 was notable for its focus on grassroots organizing and mobilization. He made frequent visits to small towns and held meet-and-greet events with voters, emphasizing the need for a representative who would be accessible and responsive to constituents' concerns.

However, Kim has faced criticism from some constituents over his decision to vote in favor of the second impeachment of President Trump. Some constituents argue that Kim should have focused on issues specifically relevant to his district rather than engaging in a partisan political fight.

In the 2020 election, Kim faced a tough re-election campaign against Republican challenger David Richter. Ultimately, however, Kim prevailed, winning by a margin of around 5 percentage points.

Overall, Andy Kim is a well-respected member of Congress who has proven himself to be a strong advocate for his constituents and for the issues they care about. Whether he will be successful in his efforts to promote healthcare, gun control, and environmental protection remains to be seen, but his commitment to these issues is clear.
