Mark Pocan is a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district, a seat he has held since 2013 after succeeding Tammy Baldwin. He is also a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the LGBT Equality Caucus. 

One of Pocan's most noteworthy accomplishments was that in 2013, he led the effort to pass the first-ever federal bill prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, known as the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. Furthermore, Pocan has been a vocal advocate for climate change action, pushing for policies such as carbon taxes and green energy investment. 

On some of his social views, he's pro-choice and LGBTQ+ rights advocate. He supports gun control laws. As for taxes, Pocan has suggested a number of progressive tax reforms, including increasing taxes on the wealthy and corporations while decreasing taxes on the middle class.

However, not all of Pocan's actions and statements have been without controversy. He has been criticized by some for his support of the BDS movement, which aims to boycott and divest from Israel. Pocan's support for the movement has drawn concern and condemnation from groups who see BDS as discriminatory and anti-Semitic.

One of Pocan's most famous quotes is I believe in the people of Wisconsin, not the politicians in Madison or Washington, DC. This quote speaks to Pocan's focus on grassroots organizing and giving power back to the people. 

In 2020, Pocan made headlines when he introduced legislation that would abolish the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a move that was met with both support and backlash from the public. 

Overall, whether you agree with his progressive policies or not, Pocan has proven to be a strong and dedicated advocate for his constituents and causes he supports.
