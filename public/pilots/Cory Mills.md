Cory Mills is a former US Army Special Forces member who has made a name for himself in politics. In addition to serving in the military, Mills has experience working in counter-terrorism and defense contracting, helping him build a strong foundation for his political campaigns. Mills is also known for his expertise on foreign policy, specifically in relation to China and the Middle East.

Mills was the Republican nominee for Oregon's 4th congressional district in 2020, but ultimately lost to the incumbent Democrat. Despite his defeat, Mills gained attention for his strong stance on issues such as immigration, healthcare, and taxation.

One of Mills' standout achievements in his political career was being honored by the US House of Representatives for his service in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mills was also the first-ever recipient of the Secretary of Defense Medal for the Global War on Terrorism.

Mills has been vocal about his opposition to illegal immigration, advocating for increased border security and stricter enforcement of immigration laws. He also supports repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a more market-based healthcare system, which he believes will increase competition and lower costs for patients.

On the issue of taxation, Mills is in favor of simplifying the tax code and reducing taxes for individuals and businesses. He has also expressed concern over the national debt and has advocated for cutting government spending and eliminating wasteful programs.

While Mills has earned praise for his military service and dedication to conservative principles, he has also faced controversy in his political career. In 2020, he came under fire for sharing a meme on social media that some interpreted as racist.

Despite the controversy, Mills remains a candidate to watch in future elections. With his military background and strong stance on important issues, he has the potential to appeal to a wide range of voters. As Mills himself has said, I’m much more than a guy with a gun. I’m a guy with a plan.
