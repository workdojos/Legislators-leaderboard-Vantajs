Dan Goldman is a former federal prosecutor and a key figure in the impeachment inquiry against President Trump. He worked as a senior advisor to the House Intelligence Committee and played a leading role in the impeachment investigation.

Goldman's legal career began as a prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, where he focused on terrorism and organized crime cases. He later joined the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia and worked on a wide range of white-collar crime cases, including money laundering and securities fraud.

During the impeachment proceedings against President Trump, Goldman became a familiar face on cable news shows and was praised for his calm and measured demeanor. He also emerged as a formidable interrogator during the public hearings, using his legal expertise to methodically undermine the defenses of witnesses.

Goldman is a Harvard Law School graduate, and he clerked for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit. He is also a former staff attorney for the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Goldman has been outspoken about issues such as gun control and criminal justice reform. In a 2018 op-ed for The Hill, he argued that common-sense gun laws are necessary to prevent mass shootings, and he called for a federal ban on assault weapons. He has also written extensively about prosecutorial misconduct and the need for reform in the criminal justice system.

Notably, Goldman recently announced that he is running for New York's 16th Congressional District seat, which covers parts of the Bronx and Westchester County. He is running as a Democrat and has emphasized his commitment to progressive policies like universal healthcare and combating climate change.

Despite his impressive credentials and legal expertise, Goldman has not been without controversy. During the impeachment hearings, he faced criticism from some Republicans for his role in the investigation, and he was accused of being biased against President Trump.

However, Goldman has weathered these attacks and emerged as a respected figure in the legal and political communities. As he sets his sights on Congress, he will undoubtedly continue to be a force to be reckoned with in the world of politics.
