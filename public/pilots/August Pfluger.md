August Pfluger is a retired United States Air Force Colonel, a West Point graduate, and a former fighter pilot. He has served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives since 2021, representing Texas's 11th congressional district.

Pfluger is known for his conservative views on a variety of issues, including healthcare, immigration, and national security. He has expressed his support for reducing the size of government and promoting small business growth.

One of Pfluger's key accomplishments during his time in office so far has been his work on military and veterans affairs. As a former Air Force pilot, he has been a strong advocate for ensuring that veterans receive the care and support that they deserve. In a recent speech, Pfluger said: We owe it to our veterans, the men and women who have served and sacrificed for our country, to ensure that they receive the best possible care when they come home.

Pfluger has also been a vocal supporter of law enforcement and has called for increased funding for police departments across the country. In an interview with Fox News, he said, We need to make sure our law enforcement officers have the resources they need to do their job and keep our communities safe.

However, Pfluger's views on certain social and environmental issues have been controversial. He has been criticized for his stance on climate change, which some believe is not based on scientific evidence. Additionally, he has been opposed to abortion and has supported legislation to restrict access to the procedure.

Despite these controversies, Pfluger has received praise from many of his colleagues in Congress. Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy has called him a true leader who is committed to fighting for the American people. Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro has also acknowledged his military service and dedication to veterans' issues.

In the 2022 elections, Pfluger is expected to run for re-election in the 11th congressional district of Texas. His platform is likely to focus on issues surrounding veterans' affairs, law enforcement funding, and small business growth.
