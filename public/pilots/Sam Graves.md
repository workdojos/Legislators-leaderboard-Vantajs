Sam Graves is a Republican Congressman from Missouri's 6th Congressional District. He has been in Congress since 2001 and is a member of the House Committees on Transportation and Infrastructure, Small Business, and Armed Services. 

Graves has been a strong advocate for small business and has introduced numerous bills to help support and promote entrepreneurship. One of his signature pieces of legislation, the Small Business Tax Cut Act, would provide a 20% tax cut for businesses with fewer than 500 employees. 

In terms of his legislative record, Graves has successfully passed several bills that have become law, including the FAA Extension, Safety, and Security Act of 2016, which reauthorized Federal Aviation Administration programs and improved aviation safety and security measures. He also authored the Veterans Small Business Enhancement Act, which helps veterans start and grow small businesses. 

On the issue of immigration, Graves has been a staunch supporter of stricter immigration policies and has opposed measures such as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) and sanctuary cities. He has advocated for increased border security and for measures to ensure that only legal immigrants have access to public benefits. 

In terms of controversies, Graves has been criticized by some for his ties to the fossil fuel industry and for accepting campaign contributions from PACs and lobbyists. However, he has defended his record and believes that these relationships help him better understand the needs of his constituents and the industries that drive their local economy.

Graves has also been a vocal opponent of regulations that he believes stifle economic growth, particularly in the transportation and energy industries. He has supported efforts to streamline the permitting process for infrastructure projects and has been a strong advocate for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.

Interestingly, Graves is the youngest of six siblings and grew up on a farm in rural Missouri. He started his own small business at the age of 22, which he credits with giving him a firsthand understanding of the challenges facing entrepreneurs.

As Graves gears up for his next election, voters will likely be interested in his stance on key issues such as healthcare reform, tax policy, and national security. Though he has faced criticism from some quarters, Graves remains a popular figure in his district and has a track record of passing legislation that benefits his constituents.
