Val Hoyle, a Democrat from Oregon, is a seasoned politician and the former majority leader of the Oregon House of Representatives. She is currently serving her first term in the Oregon Senate representing District 14, which includes parts of Eugene and Springfield.

Hoyle has a long history of activism and fighting for progressive causes. She has been a staunch advocate of workers' rights, environmental protections, and healthcare reform. In 2018, Hoyle was awarded the 'Champion of Oregon's Working Families' award by the Oregon AFL-CIO for her leadership in promoting labor rights.

One of Hoyle's biggest achievements as a legislator came in 2016, when she spearheaded a successful effort to raise Oregon's minimum wage to $14.75 per hour by 2022. This move made Oregon one of the few states to have a $15 minimum wage in place. Hoyle has also been a vocal proponent of universal healthcare, voting in favor of a single-payer healthcare system in Oregon in 2017.

Hoyle's environmental record is also noteworthy. She has consistently pushed for legislation that promotes the use of clean energy and reduces carbon emissions. In 2016, Hoyle helped pass Oregon's Clean Electricity and Coal Transition Plan, which will phase out dirty coal-fired power plants by 2030 and increase the state's renewable energy requirement to 50%.

Hoyle has also faced some controversy during her political career. In 2016, she was criticized for her handling of sexual harassment allegations against one of her colleagues in the Oregon House. Hoyle has since apologized for her role in the situation and taken steps to improve the culture in the Capitol.

When asked about her governing philosophy, Hoyle has often quoted former Oregon Governor Tom McCall, saying, Treat Oregon like a small town. Every decision you make, ask yourself: 'Would you want to see it on the front page of the town newspaper?'

Moving forward, Hoyle has indicated that some of her main priorities include increasing access to affordable housing, investing in infrastructure, and expanding access to healthcare.

Overall, Val Hoyle is a passionate and experienced politician with a track record of fighting for progressive policies. While her handling of the sexual harassment allegations was controversial, her achievements in minimum wage increases and environmental protections cannot be ignored. Voters looking for a candidate who prioritizes workers' rights, environmental protections, and healthcare reform should consider Val Hoyle.
