Greg Steube is a representative from Florida's 17th congressional district. Steube's political career began in 2010 after he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, where he served until 2016. During his tenure in the Florida House, Steube gained a reputation for being a staunch conservative and a strong advocate for gun rights. 

Steube's record in Florida was marked by several notable achievements. In 2011, he co-sponsored a law that allowed Floridians to carry concealed weapons without a permit during a state of emergency. In 2014, Steube was instrumental in passing a law that permitted Floridians to carry concealed weapons on college campuses. 

In 2018, Steube won his seat in Congress, where he has continued to be an advocate for conservative policies. He has voted in favor of several bills related to immigration reform, national security, and infrastructure spending. 

However, Steube's tenure in Congress has not been without controversy. In 2019, he was criticized for his comments on transgender people, which some believed to be offensive. Steube has also been a vocal critic of Democrats' efforts to impeach President Trump, calling the inquiry a partisan witch hunt. 

In terms of his positions on major issues, Steube is known for his support of small government, free markets, and limited regulation. He is a strong supporter of the second amendment and has opposed efforts to restrict Americans' right to bear arms. Steube has also been critical of the Affordable Care Act, calling for its repeal and replacement. 

As Steube continues his political career, it will be interesting to see how his conservative values and record on gun rights will resonate with his constituents in Florida's 17th congressional district.
