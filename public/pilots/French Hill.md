French Hill is a Republican politician and member of the U.S. House of Representatives for the 2nd Congressional District of Arkansas. He was first elected to Congress in 2014 and has since earned a reputation as a staunch conservative with a focus on fiscal responsibility and economic growth.

Hill is a proven businessman, having worked in the banking and finance industry for over 30 years before joining politics. He served as an executive with Delta Trust & Banking Corporation and was also CEO of a consulting firm that specialized in economic development and strategic planning.

As a member of Congress, Hill has been a champion for small business and job creation. He supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which resulted in significant tax cuts for American businesses and individuals. Hill also introduced the JOBS Act of 2017 to reduce regulatory burdens on start-ups and small businesses, making it easier for them to access capital and grow.

Despite his business acumen, Hill has faced controversy. In 2018, a political action committee linked to him ran a racially charged ad targeting his Democratic opponent, Clarke Tucker, which was widely criticized as divisive and pandering to racist attitudes.

On social issues, Hill is a conservative, supporting his party's positions on abortion, gun rights, and traditional marriage. He has voted to defund Planned Parenthood and to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

In terms of foreign policy, Hill is a supporter of robust military spending and has been critical of the Obama administration's dealings with Iran. He has also expressed concern about Chinese tech firm Huawei's involvement in building 5G infrastructure in the United States, citing national security risks.

One of Hill's most notable quotes came during a debate in 2018, when he said, America's best days are ahead of us, not behind us. And that does not include socialism.

Despite Hill's controversial ad and some divisive positions, he remains a popular figure in Arkansas. In the 2020 election, he won his re-election bid with almost 57% of the vote. If he chooses to run again in the future, his focus on small business and economic growth may continue to appeal to voters in the state.
