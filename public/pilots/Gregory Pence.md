Gregory Pence is an American politician and Republican member of the US House of Representatives, representing the 6th Congressional District of Indiana. Pence was born in 1956 in Columbus, Indiana, and is the older brother of former Vice President Mike Pence. He received his bachelor's degree from Loyola University in Chicago and his law degree from Indiana University.

During his time in Congress, Pence has focused on advancing policies that promote economic growth and job creation, particularly in the manufacturing sector. He has also been a vocal advocate for conservative social values, including opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage.

One of Pence's most significant achievements in Congress was the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which he was instrumental in crafting. The legislation, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump, lowered tax rates for individuals and corporations and simplified the tax code.

Pence has also been a critic of government regulation, arguing that excessive regulation hinders economic growth and job creation. In 2019, he introduced the Regulatory Improvement Act, which aimed to streamline the regulatory process and reduce unnecessary burdens on businesses.

However, Pence's political views have not been without controversy. In 2016, he faced criticism for his opposition to a proposed anti-discrimination ordinance in Columbus, Indiana. The ordinance, which would have prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, was ultimately defeated.

When asked about the controversy, Pence stated, I don't think it's right to discriminate against anyone for any reason. But I also believe that individuals and businesses should have the right to make their own decisions regarding whom they work with and serve.

In terms of future elections, it is worth noting that Pence has been a strong supporter of President Trump and his policies. He has expressed support for the president's efforts to strengthen border security and reduce illegal immigration, as well as his foreign policy initiatives.

Overall, Gregory Pence is a seasoned politician with a track record of advocating for conservative economic and social policies. While some of his views may be controversial, he is undoubtedly a candidate to watch in future elections, particularly in the state of Indiana.
