Eli Crane is a former U.S. Navy SEAL turned entrepreneur and politician. As a Republican candidate for Congress in Arizona's 1st Congressional District, Eli has positioned himself as a conservative outsider, advocating for limited government, free markets, and a strong national defense.

One of Eli's standout achievements is his founding of Bottle Breacher, a company that makes bottle openers out of recycled .50 caliber bullets. The company started in Eli's garage in 2012 and has since grown to employ over 50 veterans and military spouses. Bottle Breacher has been featured on Shark Tank, Oprah's Favorite Things, and in numerous other media outlets.

Eli has also been active in supporting various veterans' organizations, including the Travis Manion Foundation and Homes for Our Troops. In 2016, he was awarded the Purple Heart Patriot Project Award for his work in advocating for injured veterans.

On key issues, Eli has taken a strong stance in support of the Second Amendment and against illegal immigration. He has also spoken out against the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), arguing that it has led to higher costs and fewer choices for Americans.

However, Eli has faced some controversy during his campaign. In 2018, he was accused of plagiarizing portions of a speech he gave at a campaign event. The accusations were later dropped after Eli issued an apology and took responsibility for the mistake.

Despite this misstep, Eli has remained a strong contender in the race for Arizona's 1st Congressional District. He has been endorsed by numerous conservative groups and politicians, including former Arizona Governor Jan Brewer.

As Eli himself has said, I'm not a politician, I'm a problem solver. With his commitment to service and his track record of entrepreneurial success, he may be a candidate to watch in future elections.
