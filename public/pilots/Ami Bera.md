Ami Bera is a member of the United States House of Representatives, serving as representative for California's 7th congressional district. Bera, a physician by profession, has been a Democratic member of the House since 2013. 

One of Bera's significant achievements was the drafting and passing of a bill aimed at expanding access to mental health services for schoolchildren. The bill, called the Mental Health in Schools Act, was introduced in 2011 and was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2013. This bill has provided much-needed support for children who suffer from mental illnesses and has proven to be a crucial step in addressing the mental health crisis in America.

As a member of Congress, Bera serves on the following committees: Foreign Affairs Committee, Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and the Ethics Committee. In these roles, Bera has been able to weigh in on significant issues affecting California and the United States. 

On the issue of healthcare, Bera has opposed the repeal of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. He has been a vocal advocate for protecting access to healthcare for all Americans and has actively supported legislation aimed at addressing mental health challenges and combating the opioid epidemic.

Bera's political career has not been without controversy. In 2018, his father, Babulal Bera, was sentenced to one year in prison for making illegal campaign contributions to his son's campaigns in 2010 and 2012. Although Ami Bera was not charged with any wrongdoing, the scandal had repercussions for his political career.

Despite these controversies, Bera remains a respected member of Congress, widely recognized for his work to improve mental health services for children and his commitment to healthcare and science research. As Ami Bera himself once said: You don't have to be a politician to make a difference. We all have the power to create a positive change in our communities.
