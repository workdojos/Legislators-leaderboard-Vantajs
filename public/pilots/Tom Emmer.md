Tom Emmer is a prominent Republican politician from Minnesota who has served as a member of the United States House of Representatives since 2015. Known for his conservative views and advocacy for small government, Emmer has been a vocal supporter of President Trump and his policies. 

One of Emmer's notable achievements in Congress has been his work on tax reform. He was a key sponsor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was signed into law by President Trump in 2017. The legislation lowered individual and corporate tax rates, eliminated certain deductions, and increased the standard deduction. Proponents argue that this has stimulated economic growth while critics maintain that the benefits have mainly gone to the wealthy.

Emmer has also been a proponent of free trade and has criticized the protectionist policies of the Trump administration. In 2017, he co-sponsored a bill that would have required the president to obtain congressional approval before imposing certain tariffs. This stance has caused some tension with the Trump administration, which has been focused on renegotiating trade deals and preventing American companies from outsourcing jobs overseas.

Beyond his work in Congress, Emmer has a long history of involvement in Minnesota politics. He previously served as a member of the Minnesota House of Representatives and ran for governor in 2010, but lost to Democrat Mark Dayton. Emmer has also been active in the private sector, working in banking and real estate before his political career.

One controversy that has dogged Emmer's career was his 2010 sponsorship of a bill that would have allowed businesses to refuse service to customers based on their sexual orientation. The bill was widely criticized as discriminatory and ultimately failed to pass. Emmer has since stated that he supports equal rights for all individuals regardless of their sexual orientation.

In terms of Emmer's stance on major issues, he is a strong supporter of gun rights and has an A rating from the National Rifle Association. He also opposes abortion and has supported legislation to restrict access to it. Emmer has been a vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act and has advocated for its repeal.

In conclusion, Tom Emmer is a seasoned politician with a mixed record of achievements and controversies. He has been a key supporter of the Trump administration's policies while also opposing some of its protectionist measures. His record on issues such as tax reform, gun rights, and abortion will be important factors for voters to consider in future elections, along with his history of involvement in Minnesota politics.
