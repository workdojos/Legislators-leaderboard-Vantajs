Doug Lamborn is the current representative for Colorado's 5th congressional district, serving since 2007. A Republican, he has become well-known in his district for his strong conservative stance on issues such as immigration, gun control, and abortion.

Throughout his political career, Lamborn has been a vocal advocate for limited government, lower taxes, and individual freedom. He has consistently received high ratings from organizations such as the National Rifle Association and the American Conservative Union.

One of Lamborn's most notable achievements was his work in securing funding for a new state-of-the-art Veterans Affairs clinic in his district. The $80 million project has been a major benefit for the community, allowing for improved access to healthcare for veterans in the area.

Despite his many accomplishments, Lamborn has not been without controversy. In 2018, he was accused of making insensitive remarks towards his colleague, Rep. Jared Polis, who is openly gay. Lamborn denied the accusations and apologized for any offense he may have caused.

Lamborn has also been a strong supporter of President Donald Trump and his agenda. He has praised Trump's efforts to lower taxes and reduce regulations, and has been a vocal advocate for building a border wall.

As the 2020 election approaches, Lamborn's conservative track record and support for Trump's policies could make him a top contender for reelection. However, his controversial comments and close association with the president may also make him a target for opposition campaigns.

One thing is for certain, voters in Colorado's 5th congressional district will be paying close attention to their representative's record and stance on major issues as they head to the polls.
