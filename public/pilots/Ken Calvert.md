Ken Calvert is a Republican politician who currently serves as the U.S. Representative for California's 42nd congressional district. First elected to Congress in 1992, he has since become one of the longest-serving members of the House of Representatives.

Calvert has gained a reputation as an advocate for limited government, fiscal conservatism, and a strong national defense. He has consistently voted for lower taxes and reduced government spending, earning him high marks from conservative advocacy groups such as the Club for Growth and the American Conservative Union.

Throughout his time in Congress, Calvert has held a number of significant committee assignments, including the House Committee on Appropriations, where he chairs the Subcommittee on Defense. As a member of this committee, he has been a vocal proponent of increased funding for the military and has supported efforts to modernize the nation's defense capabilities.

One particular controversy that has dogged Calvert throughout his career is his ties to the lobbying industry. In 2006, he came under fire for reportedly accepting thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from lobbyists, including contributions from a lobbying firm that represented companies seeking funding from the very subcommittee that he chaired. However, Calvert has denied any wrongdoing and has remained a fixture in Congress ever since.

On the issues, Calvert is known for his conservative stances on a variety of topics. He has opposed efforts to expand access to abortion and has been a vocal opponent of gun control measures. He has also been a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act and has supported efforts to repeal and replace it with a system that puts more control in the hands of consumers.

Despite his controversies, Calvert remains a popular figure among Republican voters in California's 42nd district. He has won reelection by wide margins in recent years, and his track record of small government, pro-military policies continues to resonate with many voters in the region.

- The men and women of our armed forces put their lives on the line every day to protect our freedom. We owe them the best equipment and training possible.
