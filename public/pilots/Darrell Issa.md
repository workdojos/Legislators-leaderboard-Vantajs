Darrell Issa is a Republican politician and businessman who has served in the United States House of Representatives representing California's 49th congressional district from 2001 to 2019. He is also known for his involvement as the Chair of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee during the Obama administration.

Issa has been a strong advocate for technology and innovation, having earned a degree in electronics technology before founding his own company, Directed Electronics. He has pushed for technology advancements in government and private industries, which has earned him the nickname the car alarm king in reference to his company's success in the automotive industry.

However, Issa's tenure in Congress has not been without controversy. In 2011, he led the charge for an investigation into the ATF's Fast and Furious operation, which allowed weapons to be transported across the border without proper monitoring. Additionally, he was criticized for his handling of the Benghazi attack investigation, where he accused the Obama administration of misleading the public.

On major issues, Issa is a proponent of limited government and has been an advocate for free-market principles. He has been a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare, and has pushed for its repeal. He is also pro-life and supports the Second Amendment.

In terms of notable achievements during his time in Congress, Issa sponsored the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act (DATA), which aims to increase transparency and accountability in federal spending. He also played a key role in the creation of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, which sought to create job growth and provide support for small businesses.

Issa is known for his pragmatic and outspoken approach to politics. He once famously said, I'm considered tough, uncompromising, and hard-nosed. But let me tell you, I have a heart. I just believe that sometimes, the best way to get people to work together is to give them a common enemy.

Regardless of your political affiliation, it's important to research and evaluate a candidate's stances and track record in order to make an informed decision at the ballot box.
