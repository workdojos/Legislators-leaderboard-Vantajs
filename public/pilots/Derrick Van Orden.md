Derrick Van Orden is a Republican candidate running for Congress in Wisconsin's Third Congressional District. A Navy veteran, farmer, and author, Van Orden brings a diverse range of experiences to his campaign.

Van Orden has been vocal about his support for small businesses and reducing regulations, citing his own struggles as a farmer to keep up with government bureaucracy. He believes in maintaining a strong military and increasing funding for veterans' services.

On education, Van Orden supports school choice and believes that parents should have the ability to choose the right school for their children, whether it be public, private, or charter.

However, Van Orden's campaign has not been without controversy. He has faced criticism for past Facebook posts where he shared conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic and made derogatory comments about Muslims and LGBTQ individuals. Van Orden has since apologized for those posts and removed them from his page.

Despite the controversy, Van Orden has received endorsements from prominent Republicans, including Sarah Palin and Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson. He was also a speaker at the 2020 Republican National Convention.

Van Orden's experience in the Navy is a notable achievement in his resume. He served for 26 years as a SEAL officer and earned the Bronze Star with Valor for his actions during combat in Vietnam. He has also authored a book, Book of Man: A Navy SEAL's Guide to the Lost Art of Manhood.

In a recent interview with the Wausau Daily Herald, Van Orden said, I'm running for Congress because I believe the greatness of our nation is found in the people, not in the government. He has emphasized his commitment to putting the needs of his constituents first and working across the aisle to find solutions.

Van Orden faces a tough race against incumbent Democrat Ron Kind, who has held the seat since 1997. The Third Congressional District, which covers western Wisconsin, has historically been a swing district.
