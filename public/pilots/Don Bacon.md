Don Bacon is a veteran and Republican politician serving as the U.S. Representative for Nebraska's 2nd congressional district since January 2017. He is a former Air Force Brigadier General and has over 29 years of military experience. 

One of his most significant achievements was the passage of the Small Business Health Fairness Act, which Bacon authored and co-sponsored. This act allows small businesses to band together to negotiate lower costs for healthcare for their employees, making healthcare more affordable for struggling families. 

Bacon has also been a strong advocate for national security. He spearheaded a bill that authorized $2.4 billion in funding for missile development to counter Russia's intermediate-range missile program. He also supported the increase in funding for the Air Forceâ€™s nuclear modernization program. Bacon advocates for a strong military, and he believes that it is critical for America's defense capabilities, and he has been vocal against defense cuts. 

While Bacon has achieved many successes during his congressional tenure, his voting record has been controversial. He has voted against funding for Planned Parenthood, against gun control measures, and in favor of rolling back environmental protections. He has also been criticized for his lack of support for climate change prevention initiatives.

When asked about his beliefs, Bacon has stated that he is a pro-life politician that believes in family and faith. He has also taken a hardline stance on immigration, advocating for the construction of a border wall and supporting measures to reduce illegal immigration. 

When questioned about the polarization of American politics, Bacon stated, I think we all have to do a better job of listening to each other and understanding where each other is coming from... I think we need more civility and less name-calling. 

As voters evaluate the performance of their elected officials, Don Bacon stands as a candidate with a proven track record of leadership and experience, but also as one with a particularly controversial voting record. Viewed as a whole, his beliefs and actions in Congress may appeal to those who are in favor of fiscally conservative fiscal policy and a strong national defense, while those who value individual freedoms and environmental protection may criticize his positions on some issues.
