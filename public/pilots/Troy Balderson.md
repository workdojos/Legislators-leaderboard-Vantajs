Troy Balderson is a Republican politician and member of the United States House of Representatives. He represents Ohio's 12th congressional district, which includes portions of Franklin, Licking, and Marion counties in Ohio.

Balderson was elected to the United States House of Representatives in a special election held on August 7, 2018, to fill the seat vacated by Pat Tiberi. He had previously served in the Ohio State Senate from 2011 to 2018. Prior to his time in politics, Balderson was a small business owner and farmer.

During his time in the Ohio State Senate, Balderson sponsored legislation focused on job creation and economic growth, such as the Small Business Investment Program and the Unemployment Compensation Reform Bill. He has also played a key role in tackling the opioid crisis in Ohio, working to improve access to treatment and support for those suffering from addiction.

In Congress, Balderson has focused on issues such as increasing job opportunities and funding for rural infrastructure. He has also co-sponsored legislation to reduce healthcare costs and improve access to affordable care.

However, Balderson has faced controversy over his stance on certain issues. He has been criticized for his support of President Trump's travel ban and his vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, he has been criticized for his ties to the fossil fuel industry and his skepticism of climate change.

Despite these controversies, Balderson has maintained a strong presence in Ohio politics and has earned endorsements from major Republican figures, including Vice President Mike Pence. His background as a small business owner and experience in the Ohio State Senate make him an appealing candidate to many voters.

In a statement on his campaign website, Balderson says, I am committed to working tirelessly to represent the people of the 12th District and to fight for policies that will create more jobs, increase access to quality healthcare, and improve infrastructure in our communities.

There are likely to be future elections in Ohio's 12th congressional district, and voters will need to carefully consider where Balderson stands on key issues before casting their ballots. Regardless of political affiliation, it is important to carefully evaluate a candidate's record and background before making a decision.
