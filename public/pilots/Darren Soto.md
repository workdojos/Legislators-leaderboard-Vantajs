Darren Soto is an American politician and lawyer who currently serves as the U.S. Representative for Florida's 9th congressional district, comprising parts of Orange and Osceola counties. Born on February 25, 1978, he is of Puerto Rican ancestry and is the first Floridian of Puerto Rican descent to be elected to Congress.

Soto's political career began in 2007 when he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives, becoming the first Puerto Rican to represent Osceola County in the state legislature. During his tenure, he championed a range of issues related to education, healthcare, and environmental protection, earning him a reputation as a strong advocate for his constituents.

In 2016, Soto ran for and won a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, succeeding Alan Grayson who left the position to run for Senate. Since then, he has been a vocal voice on a range of issues, including immigration reform, healthcare, and climate change. As a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, he has worked to promote policies that benefit Latino communities across the country.

One of Soto's most notable achievements in Congress has been his advocacy for Puerto Rican statehood. Following the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in 2017, he introduced the Puerto Rico Admission Act, which seeks to grant statehood to the island territory. According to Soto, statehood would provide Puerto Ricans with the same rights and protections enjoyed by mainland Americans, while also bringing much-needed economic stability to the region.

In addition to his work on Puerto Rican statehood, Soto has been a strong advocate for sensible gun control laws, citing the tragic shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida as a driving force behind his efforts. He has also been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, arguing that health care is a basic human right that should be accessible to all Americans.

Despite his accomplishments, Soto's tenure in Congress has not been without controversy. In 2019, he faced criticism for accepting campaign contributions from the payday lending industry, leading some to question his commitment to consumer protection measures. However, Soto defended his position, arguing that the industry provides much-needed financial services to underserved communities.

Overall, Darren Soto has been a strong and vocal advocate for his constituents both at the state and federal levels. As he continues to serve in Congress, his commitment to important issues like healthcare, climate change, and Puerto Rican statehood is likely to make him a much-watched political figure in the years ahead.
