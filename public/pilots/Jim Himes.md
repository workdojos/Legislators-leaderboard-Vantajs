Jim Himes has been a member of Congress representing Connecticutâ€™s 4th district since 2009. He is a graduate of Harvard University and came from the world of finance before entering politics. Himes has established himself as a key figure on financial issues during his tenure in Congress, where he serves on the Financial Services Committee.

One of Jim Himes's most notable achievements was his role in crafting and passing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. This landmark legislation, which was signed into law in 2010, aimed to prevent another financial crisis by implementing regulations on banks and other financial institutions. Himes was a key player in negotiating the legislation and has continued to advocate for financial reform during his time in Congress.

On social issues, Himes is known for his support of marriage equality and reproductive rights. He has also been a vocal advocate for gun control measures, calling for expanded background checks and other common-sense gun reforms.

Himes has been a vocal critic of President Trump's policies, particularly on issues related to immigration and healthcare. He has also been a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act and was a vocal opponent of the Republican effort to repeal and replace the law in 2017.

In terms of controversy, Himes has faced criticism for his ties to the financial industry. He has received significant campaign contributions from Wall Street banks and financial companies, leading some to question his commitment to financial reform.

Despite this criticism, Himes remains popular in his district and has been easily re-elected in each of his five campaigns. He has also gained a reputation as a thoughtful and intelligent legislator, with former President Barack Obama once calling him one of the most thoughtful and hardworking members of Congress. 

In addition to his work in Congress, Himes is also involved in some notable charitable and community organizations. He serves on the board of Building One America, a non-profit aimed at promoting diverse communities and affordable housing, and is also an active supporter of the Stamford chapter of AmeriCares, which provides healthcare and emergency assistance to people in need.

One of Jim Himes's most famous quotes sums up his philosophy on politics: The job of elected officials is to figure out what's right and lead on it, regardless of the political consequences. His record on financial reform and social issues, combined with his reputation for integrity and thoughtfulness, makes him an attractive candidate for voters who value those qualities in their elected officials.
