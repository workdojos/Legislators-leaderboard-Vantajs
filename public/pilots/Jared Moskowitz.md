Jared Moskowitz is a Democratic member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 97th district which includes Coral Springs, Parkland, and parts of Margate. He was first elected in 2012 and has since gained a reputation as a passionate and effective legislator.

One of Moskowitz's most notable achievements was his role in passing major gun reform legislation in the wake of the 2018 Parkland school shooting. As a Parkland resident and former student of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Moskowitz played a key role in drafting the bill, which included provisions such as raising the age limit to purchase firearms and establishing a red flag law that allows law enforcement to seize guns from individuals who are deemed a danger to themselves or others.

Aside from his focus on gun reform, Moskowitz has also worked on a number of other issues during his time in office. He has been a vocal advocate for clean energy and has sponsored legislation to promote the use of solar power in Florida homes. He has also been a champion for mental health services, working to secure funding for programs that provide support and resources for those struggling with mental illness.

Despite his accomplishments, Moskowitz has not been without controversy. In 2019, he drew criticism for his handling of a bill that sought to ban local governments from imposing plastic straw bans. Moskowitz, who was the bill's sponsor, initially refused to hear testimony from environmental groups, leading many to accuse him of putting corporate interests above the environment. However, he later amended the bill to include provisions that would allow local governments to impose their own straw bans if they so choose.

Overall, Jared Moskowitz is a committed and influential legislator who has proven himself capable of achieving meaningful change on a number of important issues. As Florida continues to grapple with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and other pressing challenges, it will be interesting to see how he continues to lead on behalf of his constituents.
