Matt Cartwright is a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Pennsylvania's 8th congressional district. He first took office in 2013 and has since become a prominent and respected figure in Congress.

One of Cartwright's notable achievements is his commitment to advocating for workers' rights. He has introduced and sponsored several bills aimed at improving working conditions and protecting workers from exploitation. For instance, he co-sponsored the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which would strengthen workers' ability to unionize and bargain for fair wages and benefits. He has also been a vocal supporter of raising the minimum wage, ensuring paid family leave, and expanding access to affordable healthcare.

Cartwright has also made significant contributions to environmental conservation and clean energy policies. He has advocated for policies that reduce carbon emissions and protect natural resources, including sponsoring bills to promote renewable energy and reduce plastic pollution. In recognition of his environmental stances, he earned a 95% rating from the League of Conservation Voters.

On the issue of immigration, Cartwright has supported comprehensive immigration reform, including a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and has been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies. He has also pushed for policies to address the humanitarian crisis at the border and ensure that children are not separated from their families.

Critics, however, have taken issue with Cartwright's approach to gun control. While he has supported measures such as expanded background checks and a ban on assault weapons, he has also voted in favor of legislation that would allow concealed carry permit holders to carry across state lines.

Regardless, Cartwright has maintained a solid record in Congress, earning him the respect of his colleagues and constituents alike. As he once said, I think people are looking for folks in government who put country over party. That's how I run my office, that's how I approach Congress, and I think people appreciate that.
