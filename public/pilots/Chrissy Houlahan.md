Chrissy Houlahan is an American businesswoman and politician who serves as the U.S. Representative for Pennsylvania's 6th congressional district. She was first elected in 2018 and is currently serving her second term in Congress.

Houlahan's background as a veteran, businesswoman, and educator has shaped her political beliefs and priorities. She is a strong advocate for public education and has worked to increase funding for schools and colleges. She also supports expanding access to healthcare, protecting the environment, and investing in infrastructure.

One of Houlahan's most notable achievements in Congress has been her work on reforming the military justice system. She has introduced legislation that would require the military to have an independent prosecutor for sexual assault cases and would allow survivors of sexual assault to seek justice outside of the military justice system.

Houlahan has also been vocal in her support of the LGBTQ+ community. She was one of the 10 House Democrats to vote against a bill that would have allowed adoption agencies to discriminate against queer couples based on religious beliefs.

In addition to her legislative work, Houlahan has received praise for her responsive and transparent approach to governing. She holds frequent town hall meetings and has been known to respond directly to constituents on social media.

Despite her successes, Houlahan has faced criticism for supporting the impeachment of former President Donald Trump. Some constituents have accused her of putting her party loyalty over the needs of her district.

However, Houlahan remains focused on serving her constituents and fighting for their needs in a difficult political climate. As she said in a 2019 interview with the Philadelphia Inquirer, the problems that we are facing are huge, and they are solvable, but we have to tackle them together.
