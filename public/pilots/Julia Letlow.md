Julia Letlow is a Republican politician and former executive assistant at the University of Louisiana Monroe. She is currently serving as the United States Representative for Louisiana's 5th congressional district, a seat she won in a special election in March 2021. Letlow has made history as the first Republican woman to represent Louisiana in Congress.

Letlow has an educational background in communication and marketing and earned a Ph.D. in leadership studies from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2019. Her passion for education was evident during her time at the University of Louisiana Monroe, where she helped develop the school's online learning program and served as an instructor.

Letlow's campaign for Congress focused on a strong conservative platform centered on supporting small businesses, promoting family values, and protecting the Second Amendment. She has also been vocal about her support for pro-life legislation and has been endorsed by several conservative groups, including the National Rifle Association and the Louisiana Federation of Young Republicans.

Letlow has faced some criticism for her connections to the oil and gas industry, which is a significant industry in her district. Her husband, Luke Letlow, was also a congressional candidate before his death from COVID-19 complications in December 2020.

Regardless of political affiliation, many have praised Letlow for her strength and grace in the face of personal tragedy. In her victory speech after winning the special election, she paid tribute to her late husband, saying, I know that Luke is smiling down on us tonight from heaven. I have been overwhelmed by the love and support from people across this district, and I pledge tonight to make Luke proud.
