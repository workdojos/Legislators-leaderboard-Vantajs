Tony Cárdenas is a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing California's 29th Congressional District. He is currently serving his fifth term.

Born to Mexican immigrant parents, Cárdenas is known for his advocacy for Latino and immigrant communities. He was the first Latino elected to the Los Angeles City Council's San Fernando Valley District in 2003, and served as its president in 2013.

Cárdenas has made significant contributions to education reform in his district, partnering with local schools to increase college preparedness and access to vocational training. He has also been a leading voice on environmental issues, supporting renewable energy programs and fighting against climate change.

One of his most notable legislative achievements is the SMART Child Safety Act, which provides funding for the development of smart technology to prevent child deaths in hot cars. The bill was signed into law in 2019.

However, like any politician, Cárdenas has also faced controversies. In 2018, he was accused of sexually assaulting a teenage girl over a decade prior. He denied the allegations and no charges were filed after an investigation. The case received significant attention during his re-election campaign that year.

On major issues, Cárdenas aligns with the Democratic Party platform. He supports increasing access to affordable healthcare, improving public education, and protecting the environment. He has also been a vocal advocate for immigrant rights and supports comprehensive immigration reform.

In a 2018 interview, Cárdenas summed up his philosophy on governing: I believe that government should have an important role in people's lives. And when people are treated fairly and given the opportunities to be successful, it doesn't just help them, but it helps our entire society.
