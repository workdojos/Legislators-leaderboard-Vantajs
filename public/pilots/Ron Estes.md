Ron Estes is a member of the United States House of Representatives representing the 4th Congressional District of Kansas, which includes the cities Wichita, Hutchinson, and Derby. Estes graduated from the University of Kansas with a degree in civil engineering and later received his MBA from Wichita State University.

Upon being elected to Congress in 2017, Estes found himself in the national spotlight when he won a special election to replace Mike Pompeo, who had been appointed as the CIA Director. In his first campaign for re-election, Estes was able to secure a comfortable win with nearly 60% of the vote.

Estes has been a strong advocate for small business owners and has worked to promote job creation and economic growth in his district. He has been a vocal supporter of the tax cuts and job act of 2017, which was seen by many as a major legislative victory for President Trump and Republicans in Congress.

Despite his conservative track record, Estes has also been willing to break with his party when he feels that it is in the best interest of his constituents. In 2018, he was one of just 20 House Republicans to vote against the farm bill, citing concerns about work requirements for SNAP recipients.

In terms of his stance on major issues, Estes is staunchly pro-life and supports the Second Amendment. He has also been a vocal supporter of religious liberty and has spoken out against efforts to restrict the rights of Christians in America.

Some quotes from Estes that resonate with his supporters include:

- I'm committed to fighting for our conservative values and ensuring that the people of Kansas have a voice in Washington.

- As a small business owner myself, I know firsthand the challenges that entrepreneurs face every day. That's why I'm so committed to promoting economic growth and job creation in our district.

- I believe that we need to take a commonsense approach to government and work to limit the size and scope of Washington bureaucracy.

However, Estes has not been without controversy. In 2020, he was criticized for supporting President Trump's efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential Election, despite there being no evidence of widespread voter fraud.

Overall, Ron Estes has a strong track record of advocating for the people of Kansas and promoting conservative values in Congress. However, his willingness to challenge his party on key issues and his controversial stance on the 2020 Presidential Election may prove to be contentious points for voters in future elections.
