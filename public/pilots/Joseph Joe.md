Joseph Joe, the current Congressman from the 10th district of Florida, has been active in politics for over 20 years. Before becoming an elected official, he served in the United States Navy for seven years and earned a degree in Law from the University of Florida.

Joe is known for his dedication to veterans' affairs and has been recognized for his work on the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Health. He has also worked on improving access to healthcare, education, and affordable housing for veterans.

Aside from his work on veterans' affairs, Joe is a strong advocate for environmental protection and has received high ratings from organizations such as the League of Conservation Voters. He has co-sponsored legislation aimed at addressing climate change and protecting endangered species.

However, Joe's voting record has received criticism for being too conservative on social issues such as LGBTQ+ rights and women's reproductive rights. He has consistently voted against expanding access to birth control and abortion, and has opposed marriage equality.

In recent years, Joe has become more vocal on issues such as the opioid epidemic and has worked on legislation aimed at combating the crisis. He has also been a vocal supporter of criminal justice reform, co-sponsoring bills that would reduce mandatory minimums for drug offenses and increase funding for reentry programs.

On the campaign trail, Joe is known for his folksy demeanor and sense of humor. His popular campaign slogan, Joe knows best, is often seen on bumper stickers and yard signs throughout his district. One of his most popular quotes is, It doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican, I'm here to serve all of my constituents.

Overall, Joseph Joe's record shows a dedication to improving the lives of veterans and addressing environmental issues, but his conservative stance on social issues may not sit well with all voters. It will be interesting to see where he stands on major issues in future elections and how he plans to continue serving his constituents.
