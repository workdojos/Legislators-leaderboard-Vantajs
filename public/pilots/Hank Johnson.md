Hank Johnson is a United States Congressman representing Georgia's 4th congressional district. He was first elected in 2006 and has been re-elected in every subsequent election since then. Johnson has attracted attention for his outspoken views on a number of issues and has gained a reputation as an effective advocate for his constituents.

One of Johnson's most notable accomplishments is his work on the Military Justice Improvement Act, which aimed to increase accountability and transparency in the way the military handles sexual assault cases. Johnson helped to introduce this legislation in 2013 and has been a vocal advocate for its passage ever since.

Johnson has also been a leading voice when it comes to environmental issues. He has spoken out about the need to address climate change and has been a strong advocate for investing in renewable energy. In addition, he has been critical of the Trump administration's decision to roll back environmental regulations.

On the issue of healthcare, Johnson has been a strong proponent of expanding access to affordable healthcare. He has supported the Affordable Care Act and has been critical of efforts to repeal or undermine the law.

One controversy that Johnson has faced in his political career was his comments in 2010 regarding his concerns about Guam tipping over. While speaking with a Navy admiral during a House Armed Services Committee hearing, Johnson expressed concerns that the island of Guam might capsize due to overpopulation. His comments were widely ridiculed, but Johnson later clarified that he was using hyperbole to draw attention to the issue of overpopulation.

Despite this incident, Johnson has generally been well-regarded by his constituents and has been praised for his commitment to causes such as civil rights and social justice. As he continues to serve in Congress, it will be interesting to see how he continues to advocate on behalf of his constituents and push for changes that he believes will benefit all Americans.
