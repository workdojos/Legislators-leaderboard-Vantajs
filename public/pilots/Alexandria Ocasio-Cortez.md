Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) burst onto the political scene in 2018 when she defeated incumbent Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary for New York's 14th congressional district. At the time, AOC was a 28-year-old activist and organizer who had never before held elected office. Her campaign focused on progressive policies like Medicare for All, a federal jobs guarantee, and the Green New Deal.

Since then, AOC has become a national figure and one of the most prominent voices of the progressive movement. Here are some facts, figures, and quotes related to her:

- AOC received more than 110,000 votes in the 2020 election, the most of any candidate in the history of New York's 14th congressional district.
- She has been a vocal advocate for climate justice and was a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal resolution, which called for a 10-year mobilization to transition the U.S. to a 100% clean energy economy.
- AOC has also been a strong proponent of Medicare for All, which would establish a single-payer, government-run healthcare system in the U.S. This policy has become increasingly popular in recent years, with a majority of Democrats supporting it.
- In 2019, AOC questioned Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during a congressional hearing about the platform's role in spreading misinformation and allowing political ads with false claims. Her questioning received widespread attention.
- AOC has been a target of criticism and harassment from conservative media and politicians. In 2019, a Republican congressman reportedly posted a photo of her on social media and suggested that she was a terrorist. AOC called out the congressman's behavior and received support from many of her colleagues in Congress.
- AOC has also been praised for her social media savvy and ability to connect with younger voters. She has over 11 million followers on Instagram and has used the platform to share behind-the-scenes looks at her life in Congress and engage with her constituents.
- On foreign policy, AOC has been critical of U.S. military interventions abroad and has called for a shift towards diplomatic solutions. She has also been a vocal supporter of Palestinian human rights and was among the lawmakers who spoke out against Israel's recent military actions in Gaza.

Here are a few quotes from AOC that highlight her positions and values:

- I believe that healthcare is a human right. I believe that education is a human right. I believe that housing is a human right. And I believe that the right to migrate is a human right.
- In my opinion, Democratic socialism means putting democracy and society first, instead of capitalism first.
- It's not a question of whether we can afford to do these things. It's a question of whether we can afford not to do them.
- We should not be haunted by the specter of being automated out of work. We should be excited by that. But the reason we're not excited by it is because we live in a society where if you don't have a job, you are left to basically die.

AOC has been a polarizing figure in American politics, but there is no denying that she has had a significant impact on the national conversation about progressive policies and democratic values. As voters look towards future elections, her views on healthcare, climate change, and economic justice will continue to be a major part of the political discourse.
