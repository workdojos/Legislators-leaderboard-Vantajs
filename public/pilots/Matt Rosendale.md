Matt Rosendale is an American politician and businessman who currently serves as the U.S. Representative for Montana's At-large congressional district. He was elected in 2020, defeating the incumbent Democrat Kathleen Williams by a narrow margin of 56% to 44%.

Hailing from Maryland, Rosendale moved to Montana in 2002 and became involved in local politics, serving in the Montana House of Representatives from 2011 to 2013 and in the Montana Senate from 2013 to 2017. During his tenure, he championed conservative causes such as lower taxes, less regulation, and Second Amendment rights.

In his campaign for Congress, Rosendale emphasized his support for President Trump and his policies, particularly on issues such as immigration, national security, and healthcare. He also touted his business experience as a real estate developer, rancher, and insurance commissioner.

However, Rosendale has faced criticism from some quarters for his controversial statements and actions. In 2018, he was caught on tape saying that Montana voters would be stupid to elect a Democrat like Sen. Jon Tester. He also received backlash for not disclosing his financial ties to a company that he appointed to manage Montana's health insurance exchange.

On policy issues, Rosendale is generally aligned with the Republican Party, advocating for limited government, individual liberty, and free-market solutions. He has voiced his opposition to the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), the Green New Deal, and other progressive proposals.

As a member of Congress, Rosendale has sponsored or co-sponsored several bills related to veterans' healthcare, energy policy, and Second Amendment rights. He has also been a vocal critic of the Biden administration's immigration policies, calling for stronger border security and stricter enforcement of immigration laws.

Despite his controversies, Rosendale remains a popular figure among conservative voters in Montana and beyond. As he once put it, I'm not a politician. I'm a rancher, a businessman, and a patriot who's fed up with the way things are going in Washington. Whether he can translate that sentiment into legislative success remains to be seen.
