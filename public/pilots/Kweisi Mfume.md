Kweisi Mfume is an American politician and member of Congress from Maryland's 7th congressional district. He served as a member of the US House of Representatives from 1987 to 1996 before leaving Congress to become the President and CEO of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1996 to 2004.

During his time in Congress, Mfume was known for his passionate advocacy for civil rights and social justice. He was a strong supporter of affirmative action, voting rights, and equal pay for women. He also authored several important pieces of legislation, including the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, which made voter registration easier and more accessible for Americans.

One of Mfume's most notable accomplishments in Congress was his successful effort to establish the first national museum dedicated to African American history and culture. He introduced the legislation that created the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened its doors in 2016.

Mfume's tenure as CEO of the NAACP was marked by significant organizational and financial improvements. He led the NAACP through one of its most successful periods, expanding its membership and increasing its visibility on a national level. Under his leadership, the organization also successfully lobbied for the renewal of the Voting Rights Act in 2006.

However, Mfume's time at the NAACP was also mired in controversy. In 1998, he was accused of using NAACP funds to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by a former employee. Mfume denied the allegations, but the incident tainted his reputation and led to his resignation from the organization in 2004.

In terms of his political stances, Mfume is a Democrat who supports progressive policies such as Medicare for All, criminal justice reform, and increased funding for public education. He has also spoken out against police brutality and systemic racism in law enforcement.

In summary, Kweisi Mfume is a seasoned politician with a strong track record of advocating for civil rights and social justice. While his tenure at the NAACP was not without controversy, his accomplishments in Congress and in leading the organization make him a formidable candidate for any future elections. Mfume's support for progressive policies may resonate with voters who prioritize income inequality, healthcare, and racial justice in their voting decisions.
