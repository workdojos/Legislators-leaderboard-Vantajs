Lou Correa is a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives from California's 46th congressional district, serving since 2017. Prior to his election to Congress, Correa served in both the California State Assembly and State Senate.

A well-known quote from Correa is: It's not about what party you belong to, it's about what you do for your community. This quote speaks to Correa's commitment to working across the aisle to get things done for his constituents.

One of Correa's key achievements in Congress has been his work on improving access to affordable healthcare. In 2019, he introduced legislation aimed at reducing the cost of prescription drugs and expanding access to healthcare for low-income families. Additionally, Correa has been a strong advocate for protecting the Affordable Care Act and ensuring that all Americans have access to quality healthcare.

On the issue of immigration, Correa has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration's policies, particularly the separation of families at the southern border. He has been a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform and has worked to create pathways to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.

In terms of controversies, Correa has faced criticism from some advocates for his stance on net neutrality. In 2018, he was one of only a handful of Democrats to vote in favor of a bill that would have rolled back net neutrality protections.

Despite this controversy, Correa remains a popular and well-respected member of Congress. His commitment to working across the aisle and his focus on improving access to healthcare and immigration reform make him a compelling candidate for voters looking for a representative who will fight for their interests.
