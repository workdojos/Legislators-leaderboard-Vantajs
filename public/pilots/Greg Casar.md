Greg Casar is a member of the Austin City Council and has been representing the city's District 4 since 2015. Born and raised in Laredo, Texas, Casar attended the University of Virginia before moving to Austin in 2010.

During his time on the City Council, Casar has gained a reputation as a progressive champion, advocating for issues such as affordable housing, workers' rights, and environmental protection. He was instrumental in passing the Austin City Council's Paid Sick Leave ordinance in 2018, which required employers to provide their employees with paid sick leave. The law faced legal challenges and was ultimately struck down by the Texas Supreme Court in 2019.

Casar has also been a vocal proponent of increasing the minimum wage, and was a co-sponsor of the successful proposal to raise the minimum wage for Austin city employees to $15 an hour in 2020.

In addition to his work on economic issues, Casar has been a strong advocate for immigrant rights. In 2017, he led the City Council in passing a resolution condemning President Trump's travel ban and affirming Austin's commitment to being a welcoming city for immigrants and refugees. He has also worked to expand access to legal services for undocumented immigrants.

Despite his record of progressive accomplishments, Casar has faced criticism from some quarters for his close ties to labor unions and his support for measures such as rent control, which some argue would have a negative impact on the city's economy.

Casar is up for re-election in 2022, and it is expected that his record of advocating for workers' rights and affordable housing will be a major focus of his campaign. He is likely to face opposition from conservative groups who view him as too liberal for Austin's traditionally moderate political climate.

One of Casar's most famous quotes is from a 2017 speech he gave at a rally in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. We will not let anyone come for our neighbors, not in our city, not in our country, he declared. The quote has since become a rallying cry for immigrant rights activists across the country.

Overall, Greg Casar is a candidate with a strong progressive track record who has been effective at advocating for important issues such as affordable housing and workers' rights. However, his support for controversial policies such as rent control could be a potential hurdle in his re-election campaign.
