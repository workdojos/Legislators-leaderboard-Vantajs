John Joyce is a Republican member of Congress representing Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District. He was first elected in 2018 and is running for reelection in 2020.

Born in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Joyce worked as a dermatologist for over two decades before entering politics. He later served as an adjunct professor at Penn State University and founded a healthcare consulting firm.

During his time in Congress, Joyce has been a vocal supporter of small businesses and job creation. He has also advocated for investments in infrastructure and the expansion of rural broadband access.

One of Joyce's notable achievements in Congress was the passage of the Small Business Runway Extension Act, which allows small businesses more time to develop their capabilities before they are forced to compete against larger, more established companies for government contracts.

Joyce has also been a supporter of President Trump's trade agenda, including the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and the trade negotiations with China. In addition, he has been a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights and has received an A rating from the National Rifle Association.

However, Joyce has faced criticism for his stance on healthcare. He has voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and was a co-sponsor of the Protecting American Workers' Healthcare Act, which would have expanded the use of short-term, limited-duration health insurance plans that do not meet ACA requirements.

In conclusion, John Joyce has a strong track record of supporting small businesses, job creation, and rural infrastructure. He has also been a vocal supporter of President Trump's trade agenda and Second Amendment rights. However, his stance on healthcare may be a contentious issue for some voters. Ultimately, prospective voters should closely examine his positions on these and other major issues before making their decision in the upcoming election.
