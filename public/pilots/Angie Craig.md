Angie Craig is a Democratic politician who has served as the U.S. Representative for Minnesota's 2nd congressional district since 2019. She is known for her advocacy of healthcare affordability, economic policies that help small businesses, and running campaigns that put the constituents first.

One of her major achievements was leading a successful effort to block a Republican-led plan to cut healthcare for millions of Americans. Craig has consistently pushed for affordable healthcare options, such as co-sponsoring ‘The Medicare Negotiation and Competitive Licensing Act 2019'. She has also introduced crucial legislation such as the “Affordable Prescriptions for Patients Act 2019'' which would ban abusive practices by pharmaceutical manufacturers and create transparency in drug pricing.

Apart from healthcare, Craig has prioritized the needs of small businesses, as they constitute the backbone of America’s economy. Additionally, she has also pushed for clean water and air in her district and the country as a whole. In 2021, she successfully secured $20 million in appropriations for critical infrastructure projects in her district.

On the issue of equality, Craig is all in for the LGBTQ+ community, affirmative action, reproductive healthcare, and the promotion of equal opportunities for all Americans. Craig is widely recognized as one of the most comprehensive and accessible members of Congress who always prioritizes her constituents before any partisan politics.

Craig once said, “I’m inspired and humbled by the resilience of those who believe that we are still better off together, that our greatest strength lies in the ability of our neighbors and our communities to lift one another up, and that we can always do better when we work together to forge a shared destiny.”

In terms of controversies, some conservative outlets have claimed that Craig's actions supporting the impeachment of former President Donald Trump were motivated by her personal animosity. However, the evidence shows that she firmly held her ground and acted within her patriotic and professional capacity, delivering the message to the American people that actions have consequences.

As a voter, it is imperative that you are well versed with the track record of candidates that you may support in future elections. Angie Craig's achievements are an impressive testament to her leadership skills.
