Meet Lauren Underwood, a rising star in the Democratic Party who made history in 2018 by becoming the youngest Black female elected to Congress at just 32 years old. Representing Illinois' 14th Congressional District, Underwood has garnered attention for her impressive achievements and strong stance on key issues.

Underwood's background in healthcare compels her to prioritize healthcare reform and access. She played a significant role in passing the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, a bill that addresses skyrocketing prescription drug prices. Additionally, she is a strong advocate for maternal health, citing her own experience as a nurse and her own mother's struggles during pregnancy. 

Underwood has also supported bills relating to immigration, gun control, and climate change. She has called for a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients, universal background checks for firearm purchases, and investing in renewable energy sources.

As a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security and the House Committee on Veteransâ€™ Affairs, Underwood has been vocal about her support for those who have served our country. During her first year in Congress, she successfully passed legislation to ensure that veteran-owned small businesses receive fair treatment when bidding for contracts.

While Underwood's accomplishments have gained her many supporters, she has also faced criticism from some who disagree with her policies. Her support for a single-payer healthcare system and a woman's right to choose have been met with opposition from some Republicans in her district.

Despite the controversy, Underwood remains committed to her goals of improving healthcare, ensuring social justice, and protecting our planet for future generations. As she once said, I'm here to do a job for the people of my district, and I don't have any other priorities but to be successful in that job.
