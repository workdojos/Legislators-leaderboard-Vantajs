Ann Wagner is a Republican politician who currently serves as the Representative for Missouri's 2nd Congressional District. Let's take a closer look at this experienced politician, her achievements, controversies, and where she stands on major issues.

Born on September 13, 1962, in St. Louis, Missouri, Ann Wagner began her career as a political activist by working for then-Congressman Jack Danforth's campaign in the mid-1970s. She later worked in the administration of President George H.W. Bush as the Co-Chair of the Republican National Committee. Wagner also worked in the private sector as the President of the Missouri Republican Party and as the Chair of the Missouri Republican State Committee.

In 2012, Wagner was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where she has served since then. She has been re-elected four times and is currently serving her fifth term. During her tenure, Wagner has been a member of several committees, including the House Financial Services Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, and the Select Committee on the Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi.

Throughout her political career, Wagner has been a champion of conservative values. She has been an advocate for individual liberty, free market capitalism, and limited government. She has also been actively involved in promoting women's rights and empowering women in leadership positions.

One of the most significant achievements of Wagner's career was the passage of the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) and Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA). These bills aim to combat online sex trafficking and hold website operators accountable for facilitating such activities. The bills received strong bipartisan support and were signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2018.

However, Wagner has also been involved in controversies during her career. In 2017, she faced criticism for her association with an anti-Muslim group called ACT for America. Wagner spoke at the group's annual convention and received a Patriot Award from them. She later denounced the group's extremist views but defended her right to speak at their event.

On key issues affecting voters, Wagner has taken a conservative stance. She is a staunch supporter of pro-life measures, including defunding Planned Parenthood and restricting access to abortion. She has also been a vocal supporter of gun rights and has received an A rating from the National Rifle Association (NRA).

In terms of economic policies, Wagner has advocated for tax cuts and reducing government regulations to stimulate job growth. She has also been a vocal proponent of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (ACA), commonly known as Obamacare.

In conclusion, Ann Wagner is an experienced politician with a track record of advocating for conservative values. She has achieved significant legislative success, such as the passage of laws aimed at combating sex trafficking. However, her association with controversial groups has attracted criticism. Her conservative stances on issues such as abortion, gun rights, and economic policies may appeal to some voters, while potentially alienating others.
