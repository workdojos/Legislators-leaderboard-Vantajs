Virginia Foxx is a U.S. Representative from North Carolina and one of the most conservative members of Congress. With over a decade of experience in the House of Representatives, Foxx has made a name for herself as a fierce advocate for limited government and fiscal responsibility.

One of Foxx's most notable accomplishments in Congress was the passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, a landmark bill that provided over $6 billion in funding for medical research and innovation. Foxx also played a critical role in the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which lowered tax rates for many Americans and helped spur economic growth.

However, Foxx has also faced her share of controversy during her time in Congress. In 2017, she came under fire for comments she made on the House floor suggesting that people who don't lead good lives should not be eligible for healthcare. These remarks were widely criticized as insensitive and callous, and Foxx ultimately apologized for them.

When it comes to policy positions, Foxx is perhaps best known for her strong opposition to abortion rights. She has consistently supported legislation that would restrict access to abortion and defund organizations like Planned Parenthood. Foxx has also been a vocal critic of the Affordable Care Act, and has advocated for a full repeal of the law.

Despite her conservative stances on many issues, Foxx has actually been relatively supportive of LGBTQ rights in recent years. She has voted in favor of bills that would protect LGBTQ individuals from workplace discrimination, and has even expressed support for same-sex marriage.

Overall, Virginia Foxx is a polarizing figure in Congress, with supporters praising her commitment to conservative principles and detractors criticizing her sometimes controversial remarks and policy positions. As she continues to serve in the House of Representatives, it will be interesting to see how her views and priorities evolve in the years to come.
