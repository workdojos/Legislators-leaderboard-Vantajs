Nick LaLota is an experienced politician and lawyer who has served as the Suffolk County Board of Elections Commissioner since 2013.

LaLota has faced both praise and criticism during his time in office. One notable accomplishment of his tenure includes the successful implementation of early voting in Suffolk County, which saw a record-breaking turnout in the 2019 general election. Additionally, LaLota has been praised for his efforts to increase election security measures following concerns over foreign interference in the 2016 presidential election.

However, LaLota has also been involved in controversial incidents during his career. In 2003, he was charged with third-degree assault and pleaded guilty to harassment after allegedly pushing a female colleague at a party. More recently, in 2020, LaLota came under fire for his handling of the absentee ballot count in a closely watched congressional race.

On major issues, LaLota’s politics lie on the Republican side of the spectrum. In a 2019 interview, he expressed support for President Trump’s policies on immigration and national defense, while also advocating for fiscal responsibility in government spending.

Quotes from LaLota’s speeches and interviews reveal his dedication to the democratic process and his belief in the power of voter participation. “The most important thing we can do as a Board of Elections is ensure a fair, accessible, and transparent election,” he emphasized in one speech.

Overall, LaLota’s record highlights both his successes and controversies within the political sphere. As a potential candidate or future elected official, voters can consider his history of promoting early voting and election security alongside his past controversies and political views on key issues.
