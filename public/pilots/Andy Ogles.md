Andy Ogles is a prominent figure in Tennessee politics, having served as executive director of the Tennessee chapter of Americans for Prosperity and as a former county commissioner. In 2018, he ran for US Senate in Tennessee but lost in the primaries. Andy Ogles is a conservative Republican and advocates for limited government, free-market economics, and traditional family values. 

One of Andy Ogles' notable achievements was his instrumental role in successfully passing Right to Work legislation in Tennessee. Right to Work laws prohibit employers from requiring their employees to join a union or pay union dues as a condition of employment. This legislation is seen as a major victory for workers' rights and job creation, and Tennessee is now considered one of the most business-friendly states in the US. 

On the issue of healthcare, Andy Ogles has been a staunch critic of Obamacare and supports market-based solutions to improve healthcare affordability and accessibility. In a 2020 interview with Tennessean, he emphasized the need to eliminate restrictions on telemedicine and remove government regulations that drive up healthcare costs. 

However, Andy Ogles has also been criticized for his opposition to the expansion of Medicaid in Tennessee. In a statement during his 2018 Senate campaign, he argued that expanding Medicaid would lead to higher taxes and lower quality healthcare. Critics point to the fact that Tennessee has one of the highest percentages of uninsured citizens in the country, and that expanding Medicaid would provide much-needed coverage to vulnerable and low-income individuals. 

Despite his political positions, Andy Ogles has been praised by both Republicans and Democrats for his friendly and accessible approach to constituents. In an interview with Tennessee Star, he emphasized the importance of listening to voters and being responsive to their needs. 

As Andy Ogles continues to be an influential political figure in Tennessee, it remains to be seen what future opportunities lie ahead for him in the state's conservative political landscape.
