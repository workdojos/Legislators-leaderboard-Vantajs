Lois Frankel is a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives for Florida's 21st congressional district. She was first elected to Congress in 2013 and has since been re-elected four times.

Frankel is known for her strong stances on social justice issues, particularly women's rights and gun violence prevention. She has been a vocal advocate for equal pay, reproductive rights, and Title IX protections, as well as comprehensive background checks for gun purchases.

On the issue of gun violence prevention, Frankel has been a leading voice in Congress. She is a co-chair of the Congressional Women's Working Group on Gun Violence, which has pushed for legislation to expand background checks and prevent individuals with histories of domestic violence from accessing firearms.

In 2018, Frankel introduced the Me Too Congress Act, which aimed to hold members of Congress accountable for sexual harassment and assault. The act requires members to use personal funds to pay for any settlements related to harassment or discrimination, rather than taxpayer dollars.

Frankel has also been praised for her work on climate change and environmental protections. She is a member of the House Climate Solutions Caucus and has supported legislation to reduce carbon emissions and invest in clean energy.

Despite her advocacy for these issues, Frankel has faced criticism for her positions on certain foreign policy issues. She has been a consistent supporter of Israel and has been criticized by some for not being more vocal in her opposition to settlements in the West Bank.

In terms of committee assignments, Frankel serves on the House Appropriations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

One of Frankel's most famous quotes came during a House debate on the 2018 budget, in which she exclaimed, The big tax cut for the wealthy wasn’t enough – they want to take away your healthcare too. God bless America, and I yield back the balance of my time.”

In terms of re-election, Frankel has faced little opposition in her previous campaigns but is likely to face challenges in 2022 as the Republican Party seeks to regain control of the House.

Overall, Lois Frankel is a strong advocate for social justice issues and gun violence prevention, though she has faced criticism for her positions on foreign policy. She remains a powerful voice in Congress and is likely to continue being a leading advocate for progressive causes.
