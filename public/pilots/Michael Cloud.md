Michael Cloud is a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Texas' 27th congressional district since July 2018. He was elected in a special election after the previous representative, Blake Farenthold, resigned amidst allegations of sexual harassment.

Since taking office in 2018, Michael Cloud has been an active member of Congress, introducing several bills and co-sponsoring many others. He has consistently voted in line with traditional conservative principles, advocating for smaller government, lower taxes, and less regulation.

One of Cloud's notable achievements was his successful push to include a provision in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act that would allow military spouses to use their spouse's home state as their state of legal residence for tax purposes. This change will help military families save money and avoid the financial burden of constantly having to change their legal residence.

In terms of controversial issues, Cloud has been a vocal opponent of abortion, voting in favor of several bills that would restrict access to abortion services. He has also been a strong advocate for Second Amendment rights, supporting measures that would expand access to firearms and eliminate restrictions on their use.

Cloud has been quoted as saying, I firmly believe in the idea that a smaller government is a better government. I think that when government gets too big and starts meddling in people's lives, we all suffer. He has emphasized the need for fiscal responsibility and has been critical of government spending on programs that he views as unnecessary or wasteful.

Notably, Cloud was one of the 147 Republican members of Congress who voted against certifying the 2020 presidential election results, citing concerns over alleged voter fraud. This decision has been widely criticized by Democrats and some Republicans as contributing to the spread of misinformation and undermining confidence in the electoral process.

Overall, Michael Cloud is a conservative politician who has been a vocal advocate for traditional Republican values. While some of his positions may be controversial, he has demonstrated a commitment to fiscal responsibility and has achieved notable successes during his time in Congress.
