Steve Womack is an American politician who has been serving as the U.S. Representative for Arkansas's 3rd congressional district since 2011. Prior to his election to Congress, Womack served in the Arkansas House of Representatives and as the Mayor of Rogers, Arkansas.

One of Womack's most notable achievements was sponsoring the legislation that created the Home Affordable Refinance Program, which helped millions of homeowners refinance their homes and avoid foreclosure during the Great Recession.

On the issue of the economy, Womack has been a supporter of pro-growth policies, such as tax cuts and deregulation. He was a strong advocate for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which he stated would provide relief to American families while creating jobs and boosting economic growth.

However, Womack has received criticism for his stance on healthcare. He has been a vocal opponent of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and has voted to repeal the law multiple times. Critics argue that repealing the ACA without a viable replacement would leave millions of Americans without healthcare coverage.
