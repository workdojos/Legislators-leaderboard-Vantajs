John Curtis is a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Utah's 3rd congressional district since 2017. A former mayor of Provo, Curtis has built a reputation for being a thoughtful and pragmatic leader, tackling complex issues with creative and effective solutions.

One of Curtis's most notable achievements as mayor of Provo was his role in developing the Google Fiber network in the city, which attracted new businesses and entrepreneurs, sparked innovation, and helped boost the local economy. In addition to infrastructure projects, Curtis also prioritized public safety and worked to improve relations between law enforcement and the community.

Curtis has also been active on environmental issues, co-sponsoring legislation to promote the use of electric vehicles and advocating for policies to reduce carbon emissions. He has expressed support for renewable energy and believes that the innovation and ingenuity of American businesses will help drive progress towards a clean energy future.

On social issues, Curtis has taken a more moderate stance than some of his Republican colleagues. He supports the legalization of medical marijuana and has expressed openness to exploring other drug policy reforms. He has also been a vocal advocate for LGBTQ rights, supporting legislation that would prohibit discrimination against individuals based on sexual orientation or gender identity.

Despite his moderate stance on some issues, Curtis has been a reliable vote for the Republican party and supported President Trump's agenda in Congress. He has voted in favor of repealing the Affordable Care Act and has opposed efforts to increase gun control measures.

In terms of his reelection prospects, Curtis faces a potentially tough challenge in the upcoming midterms. Utah's 3rd congressional district has a more conservative tilt than the state as a whole, and Curtis will need to rely on his reputation as a pragmatic problem-solver to appeal to voters across the political spectrum.
