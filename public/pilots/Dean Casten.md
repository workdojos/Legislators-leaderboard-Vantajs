Dean Casten is an American politician and businessman who currently serves as the U.S. Representative for Illinois's 6th congressional district. He was first elected in 2018 and reelected in 2020. Casten is known for his strong stances on environmental issues, clean energy, and healthcare.

Before entering politics, Casten had a successful career as the CEO of Turbosteam Corporation, a company that developed and implemented clean energy technologies. He has also served on numerous boards and committees related to climate change and renewable energy.

Casten is a vocal advocate for taking action on climate change, believing that it presents an existential threat to our planet. He has argued that investing in renewable energy will not only help protect the environment but also create new jobs and stimulate economic growth. Casten has also been a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act, arguing that access to healthcare is a fundamental right.

In 2020, Casten was named one of the most effective members of Congress by the Center for Effective Lawmaking, based on his ability to advance legislation and work with colleagues from both parties. He has also been recognized for his work on environmental issues, receiving a 100% rating from the League of Conservation Voters.

However, Casten has faced controversy over his support for the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Some of his constituents have criticized him for focusing too much on national issues rather than local concerns. Casten has defended his actions, arguing that as a member of Congress, he has a duty to uphold the Constitution and defend the rule of law.

Despite this controversy, Casten remains a respected and influential member of Congress. His dedication to protecting the environment and expanding access to healthcare has earned him a strong following among progressives in Illinois and across the country. Whether he will continue to serve as a strong voice for these issues in the future remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Dean Casten is a politician to watch.
