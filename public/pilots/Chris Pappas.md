Chris Pappas is a member of the United States House of Representatives representing New Hampshire's 1st Congressional District.

Pappas made history in 2018 by becoming the first openly gay person elected to Congress from New Hampshire. He has established a strong reputation for himself, serving on committees like Veterans' Affairs, Transportation and Infrastructure, and the Committee on Oversight and Reform. 

One of Pappas's most significant achievements since taking office was passing the VA Prescription Data Accountability Act, which will help veterans receive better healthcare by improving the information-sharing between healthcare providers. 

In terms of social issues, Pappas is a strong advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and has consistently supported legislation concerning gender identity and expression, such as the Equality Act. He has also spoken out against the Trump administration's harsh immigration policies and has backed measures to reduce gun violence.

Prior to serving in Congress, Pappas owned and operated a successful family restaurant in New Hampshire for over a decade. He has been praised for his ability to work across the aisle, forging bonds with Republicans while still championing progressive policies.

However, Pappas has also faced criticism, particularly regarding his handling of the impeachment proceedings against President Trump. Some constituents felt he waited too long to publicly endorse impeachment, while others criticized his support for only one of the two articles of impeachment. 

Overall, Chris Pappas has made a strong impression since taking office and has a proven track record of fighting for veterans and marginalized communities. His reputation as a consensus builder and willingness to work with Republicans makes him a compelling candidate for voters looking for a candidate capable of finding common ground.
