Sharice Davids is a Native American politician and attorney who currently serves as the U.S. Representative for Kansas's 3rd congressional district. She is the first openly LGBT Native American woman elected to Congress and one of the first two Native American women elected to Congress.

Davids grew up in a military family and served in the U.S. Army as a mixed martial arts fighter before earning her law degree from Cornell Law School. She worked as a White House Fellow during the Obama administration and helped implement the Affordable Care Act before returning to Kansas to practice law.

Since taking office in 2019, Davids has been a vocal advocate for healthcare reform, voting rights, and infrastructure investment. She has co-sponsored bills to expand Medicaid and combat the opioid epidemic, as well as legislation to protect LGBTQ+ rights and support small businesses. She has also been a strong supporter of the Green New Deal and the need for action on climate change.

Davids has been recognized for her work on behalf of Native American communities and was awarded the 2020 Congressional Advocate of the Year Award by the National Congress of American Indians. She has also received awards from groups advocating for women's rights and environmental protection.

Despite her achievements, Davids has faced criticism from some conservative groups and individuals. She has been accused of supporting socialism and criticized for her stance on issues such as taxation and gun control.

In addition to her political career, Davids is also a professional mixed martial arts fighter and is a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation.

One notable quote from Davids is: I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to succeed, and it should not be based on who they are, where they come from, or who they love.
