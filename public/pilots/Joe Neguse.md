Joe Neguse is a rising star among the Democratic Party and is currently serving as the U.S Representative for Colorado's 2nd congressional district. He was elected in 2018 and is the first African American to be elected to Congress from Colorado.

Neguse grew up in Colorado and is the son of Eritrean immigrants. He attended the University of Colorado Boulder, where he earned degrees in Political Science and Economics. After graduation, he studied law at the University of Colorado Law School and went on to serve as an attorney for the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies.

In his first term in Congress, Neguse became the Vice Chair of the House Democratic Caucus and sits on several committees, including the Judiciary, Natural Resources, and Oversight and Reform Committees. He is a strong advocate for environmental protection, affordable healthcare, and gun safety. 

In recent years, Neguse has been a vocal opponent of the Trump administration's policies. He was one of the first members of Congress to call for the impeachment of President Trump following the release of the Mueller report. He has also been a strong supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement and has advocated for police reform.

Neguse has received various awards and recognitions for his work in Congress. In 2020, he was named to the TIME 100 list of the most influential people in the world. He was also awarded the Sierra Club's 2020 Distinguished Service Award for his work on climate issues.

Despite his achievements, Neguse has faced some controversy. In 2020, he was criticized for accepting donations from corporate PACs, which some voters viewed as contradictory to his progressive stances.

In the 2020 Presidential Election, Neguse was a supporter of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and campaigned actively for the Democratic ticket. In future elections, he is likely to remain a key figure in the Democratic Party and a vocal advocate for progressive policies.

In his own words, Neguse said: I believe that America is a nation of second chances, a nation that is at its best when we welcome people from diverse backgrounds and experiences and work together towards our shared goals. That's the kind of America I want to help build, and that's what I will continue to strive for every day in Congress.
