Tom McClintock is a Republican Congressman from California's 4th Congressional District, serving since 2009. With a track record of conservative and libertarian values, McClintock has made his mark both as a legislator and a political commentator.

One of McClintock's most significant achievements has been his advocacy for fiscal restraint and limited government. Having famously stated that the government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else, McClintock has been a staunch advocate for reducing government spending and lowering taxes. He has consistently voted in favor of balanced budgets and against tax increases, earning him a 92% rating from the conservative organization Club for Growth.

McClintock has also been a vocal critic of Obamacare, calling it a hyperinflationary stimulus program and has been a proponent of repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act. He has pushed for health care reforms that are market-driven and patient-centered, increasing competition and reducing costs.

Despite his conservative credentials, McClintock has been willing to put country over party when necessary, as evidenced by his public opposition to President Trump's attempted coup in January 2021. He stated that I cannot vote to validate this fraudulent election, nor can I vote to overturn it. I can only vote to uphold the Constitution I have sworn to defend.

However, McClintock's stance on climate change has proven controversial, as he has consistently opposed efforts to address this global crisis. He has called climate change a natural phenomenon and has pushed against regulations that would limit greenhouse gas emissions.

In terms of social issues, McClintock is strongly opposed to abortion and has consistently voted against federal funding for Planned Parenthood. He has also spoken out against same-sex marriage and transgender rights, arguing that these are matters best left to the states.

Overall, Tom McClintock is a seasoned politician with a record of conservative values and fiscally responsible legislation. Prospective voters should consider his stance on climate change and social issues when evaluating whether or not he aligns with their values.
