Trent Kelly is a member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Mississippi's 1st congressional district since June 9, 2015. Before being elected to Congress, Kelly served in the Mississippi Army National Guard and was deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Kelly is a Republican and is known for his conservative views on a number of key political issues. He has been a vocal supporter of the Second Amendment and has advocated for the rights of gun owners. Some of Kelly's other positions include supporting a balanced budget amendment, repealing the Affordable Care Act, and cutting taxes and regulations.

Since Kelly has taken office, he has sponsored and co-sponsored several pieces of legislation, including the Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) act, which was signed into law by President Obama in December 2015. This legislation provided funding for infrastructure projects such as highway, transit, and rail projects, and it was supported by both Democrats and Republicans.

Kelly is also known for his efforts to improve conditions for veterans. He serves on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee and has been a champion for military families and veterans. In 2019, he introduced a bill that aimed to improve access to mental health services for veterans.

On the other hand, Kelly has faced some backlash for his vote against the Violence Against Women Act in April 2019. This law was originally passed in 1994 and provides funding for programs aimed at preventing and responding to domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking. Kelly stated in a press release that he voted against the bill because he felt it was overreaching into the lives of law-abiding citizens and placing burdensome mandates on states.

One interesting fact about Kelly is that he is a former district attorney and was appointed to serve as the US attorney for the Northern District of Mississippi by President George W. Bush in 2007. He served in that position until 2010.

Overall, Trent Kelly is a conservative Republican who is known for his efforts to promote veterans' rights and improve infrastructure. However, his vote against the Violence Against Women Act has drawn criticism from some voters and advocacy groups. With the next election just around the corner, it remains to be seen how his record will influence Mississippi voters and his chances of re-election.
