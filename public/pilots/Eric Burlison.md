Popular quotes and anecdotes:
- I think the government's role should be to provide infrastructure and safety and those core things, but when we go beyond that it really does interfere with our business owners and our economy.
- Burlison once got in a heated argument with another lawmaker during a legislative hearing over the state's prescription drug monitoring program. I'm not going to let you sit here and badmouth doctors like they're all criminals, Burlison said. You're just wrong on this.
- In 2018, Burlison sponsored a bill to allow charter schools to operate in Missouri. I think it's critically important that we provide as many options to families as we can, he said. If we don't like what charter schools are doing, we can always reverse that decision down the road.
