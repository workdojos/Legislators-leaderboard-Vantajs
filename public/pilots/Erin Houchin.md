Erin Houchin is a Republican member of the Indiana State Senate, representing District 47. First elected in 2014, she previously served as the Director of Communications for Indiana Lieutenant Governor Becky Skillman and as District Director for Congressman Mike Sodrel. Houchin has been a strong advocate for education reform, economic development, and reducing the size and scope of government.

Houchin has been recognized for her work by several local and national organizations. In 2015, she was named a Rising Star by the Indiana Chamber of Commerce and was also named a Legislator of the Year by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. She has been a member of the National Conference of State Legislatures and the American Legislative Exchange Council.

In terms of her policy priorities, Houchin is a strong proponent of school choice and education reform. She has championed measures to expand access to charter schools and support homeschooling families. She has also been a vocal advocate for job creation and economic growth, supporting measures to cut taxes and reduce regulation on businesses.

However, Houchin's record has also been marked by controversy. In 2015, she led a successful campaign to ban a common second-trimester abortion procedure known as dilation and evacuation. Critics argued that the law would limit women's access to safe and legal abortions and that it was a violation of their reproductive rights. The law was later overturned by a federal judge.

Houchin's position on other hot-button issues remains unclear. She has not taken a public stance on immigration reform, gun control, or healthcare, all of which are likely to be major issues in future elections.

One notable quote from Houchin came in response to criticism of her support for education reform. Indiana's schools were in trouble, and bold reforms were needed to turn things around, she said. We can't afford to wait for our education system to change on its own - we need to take action now to prepare our children for the challenges of the 21st century.

Overall, Erin Houchin is a seasoned political veteran with a record of advocating for education reform and economic growth. However, her support for controversial measures like the abortion ban may make her a divisive figure for some voters. As the political landscape in Indiana continues to evolve, it remains to be seen where Houchin will stand on key issues facing the state.
