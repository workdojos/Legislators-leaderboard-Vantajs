Kevin Mullin is a democratic member of the California State Assembly, representing the state's 22nd district since 2012. Before joining the state legislature, Mullin served as Mayor of South San Francisco, where he worked to improve transportation and expand economic opportunities for his community. With a reputation as a pragmatic problem-solver with deep roots in his district, Mullin has proven himself as a capable leader in Sacramento.

One of Mullin's key priorities in the legislature has been promoting government transparency and improving the state's political process. He was the author of the California DISCLOSE Act, a groundbreaking campaign finance reform bill that required more transparency from political donors and helped shine a light on the influence of dark money in state politics. Mullin has also been a leader in efforts to reform the state's initiative and referendum system, which has been criticized for being overly susceptible to abuse by special interests.

Mullin has been an advocate for environmental sustainability, working to promote clean energy and reduce California's carbon footprint. He has also been a strong supporter of education initiatives, including expanding access to early childhood education and increasing funding for public schools. Mullin has also been an advocate for affordable housing, recognizing that the state's high cost of living is a major barrier to economic mobility for many Californians.

One of the hallmarks of Mullin's political career has been his ability to work across the aisle and build bipartisan consensus. He has been praised by colleagues on both sides of the political spectrum for his willingness to listen, find common ground, and get things done. In an era of deep political polarization, Mullin's pragmatic approach may be a breath of fresh air for voters looking for leaders who can bridge the partisan divide and get results.

While Mullin has generally avoided controversy during his time in office, he has faced some criticism for his support of a controversial bill that would have exempted the California high-speed rail project from certain environmental reviews. The bill was eventually vetoed by Governor Jerry Brown, who cited concerns about the potential precedent it could create for future infrastructure projects.

As Mullin continues to represent his district in Sacramento, he will no doubt face new challenges and opportunities to make a difference in the lives of Californians. For voters who value transparency, sustainability, education, and affordable housing, he may be a candidate worth watching in future elections.
