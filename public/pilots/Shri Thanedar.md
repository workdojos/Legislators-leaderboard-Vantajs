Shri Thanedar may not be a household name yet, but this Michigan businessman turned politician is quickly making a name for himself in the Michigan political scene.

Born in India, Shri Thanedar moved to the United States in 1979 to pursue a degree in chemical engineering at the University of Akron. After a successful career in the chemical industry, he formed his own company, Avomeen Analytical Services, which specializes in chemical testing and product development.

An important part of Shri Thanedar's campaign platform is his advocacy for progressive policies, including universal healthcare, free college tuition, and a $15 minimum wage. He has also made education a central issue in his campaign, expressing his desire to invest in public schools and provide high-quality education to all Michigan children.

In 2018, Thanedar ran for governor of Michigan, although he ended up finishing in third place in the Democratic primary. However, despite the outcome of the race, he brought attention to important policy issues and brought new voters into the Democratic fold.

One of the most impressive things about Shri Thanedar's campaign was the amount of money he invested in his own campaign. He reportedly spent more than $10 million of his own money in the race, making him one of the biggest self-funded candidates in American political history.

Additionally, some critics have accused Thanedar of being a political opportunist, pointing to his changing political affiliations over the years.

Some of Shri Thanedar's most notable quotes include his belief that good governance can only come from good business practices, and his assertion that Michigan deserves a leader who will fight for all its citizens, not just those at the top.

Overall, while Shri Thanedar's political career is still in its early stages, he has already shown that he has the ambition, resources, and vision to potentially make a significant impact on Michigan politics in the future.
