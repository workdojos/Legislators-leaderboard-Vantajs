Brad Finstad is a former member of the Minnesota House of Representatives, having served from 2013 to 2019. During his time in the Legislature, Finstad was known for his dedication to rural Minnesota, a commitment that was reflected in his legislative priorities.

One of Finstad's major achievements during his time in office was his work on transportation infrastructure, particularly in rural parts of the state. He was instrumental in securing funding for several transportation projects, including the expansion of Highway 14, which connects Rochester and Mankato, and the construction of a new interchange in Owatonna. Thanks to his efforts, these projects were able to move forward and help improve transportation access in these areas.

Finstad also worked on issues related to economic development, including efforts to attract new businesses to rural areas. He sponsored legislation to create a loan program for small businesses in Greater Minnesota, and was a vocal advocate for expanding high-speed internet access in rural areas.

However, Finstad's tenure in the Legislature was not without controversy. In 2018, he came under fire for his comments about the #MeToo movement, which he described as a cultural wave that was getting a little insane. His comments were criticized by many, including other members of the Legislature, and he later apologized for his remarks.

Finstad's views on major issues are generally aligned with those of the Republican Party. He is pro-life and has been endorsed by the Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life PAC. He is also a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights, and has been endorsed by the National Rifle Association.

Overall, Brad Finstad has a reputation as a hard-working and committed public servant who is dedicated to improving the lives of Minnesota's rural communities. While his comments about the #MeToo movement were controversial, they do not appear to have significantly hurt his standing with voters in the past. If he were to run for office again in the future, his record on transportation infrastructure and economic development would likely be major selling points for his campaign.
