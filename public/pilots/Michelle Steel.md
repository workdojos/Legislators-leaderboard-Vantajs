Michelle Steel is currently a member of Congress representing California's 48th Congressional District. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 2020, defeating incumbent Harley Rouda.

Born in South Korea, Steel immigrated to the United States in the 1980s and became a citizen in 1994. She has a master's degree in Business Administration from Pepperdine University and worked as a certified public accountant before entering politics.

Steel has been a public servant for over two decades, serving on the California State Board of Equalization from 2007 to 2015, and the Orange County Board of Supervisors from 2015 to 2020.

During her tenure on the Orange County Board of Supervisors, Steel successfully enacted a measure to reduce regulations and cut red tape, which led to a decrease in the number of businesses leaving Orange County. She has also been a vocal advocate for fiscal responsibility and balancing the budget.

On her website, Steel highlights several issues she cares about, including limiting the size and scope of government, protecting individual freedoms, and standing up for the Constitution. She has supported legislation to repeal Obamacare, cut taxes, and secure the border.

Steel has drawn controversy for her opposition to healthcare expansion, advocating for the privatization of some programs, and receiving hundreds of campaign donations from the health insurance industry. Furthermore, as a Republican member of Congress, she has voted against investigations into the January 6th Capitol Insurrection and has consistently opposed the impeachment of former President Trump.

In her first term, Steel has gained media recognition for her vocal criticisms of the Chinese government and support for the Taiwanese. Her passion for this issue stems from her heritage as someone who grew up in South Korea with parents who fled from the North after the Korean War. 

One of Steel's memorable quotes is her response to Governor Gavin Newsome's statewide mask mandate: While I agree that wearing a mask is an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus, the governor's sweeping order infringes on local control.

With the 2022 elections just around the corner, Steel's record will undoubtedly be scrutinized by voters. Her stance on key issues such as healthcare, taxes, and immigration may prove to have a decisive effect on her political future.
