Dutch Ruppersberger is a former United States Representative for Maryland's 2nd congressional district, having served from 2003 to 2021. During his time in office, he was a member of both the Intelligence and Appropriations committees, making significant contributions to national security and government funding.

Ruppersberger was a prominent voice for cybersecurity and was deeply involved in efforts to protect government systems against cyber-attacks. In 2013, he co-sponsored the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act, which aimed to increase the sharing of information between businesses and the government to combat cyber threats. He also authored the Federal Information Security Modernization Act, which established new requirements for securing sensitive government data.

Aside from his cybersecurity work, Ruppersberger was a strong advocate for the Chesapeake Bay, a body of water that is crucial to Maryland's economy and way of life. He sponsored the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Network Reauthorization Act, which helped to preserve and promote the natural beauty of the bay for future generations.

Ruppersberger also supported efforts to improve public safety, including gun control measures and funding for community policing programs. He worked with the Obama administration to secure funding for the Baltimore City Police Department after the unrest that followed the death of Freddie Gray in 2015.

However, Ruppersberger was not without controversy during his time in office. He faced criticism for his support of the National Security Agency's surveillance programs, which some saw as a violation of privacy rights. He also faced scrutiny for his personal finances, including his ownership of several properties in Florida.

Despite these controversies, Dutch Ruppersberger remained a respected and influential figure in Congress throughout his long career. As he retires from public service, his legacy of advocating for national security, environmental protection, and public safety will undoubtedly continue to influence future generations of lawmakers.
