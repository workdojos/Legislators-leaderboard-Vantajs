Zoe Lofgren is a member of the United States House of Representatives representing California's 19th congressional district. She has been serving in Congress since 1995 and has established herself as a strong advocate for civil liberties, immigration reform, and technology policy.

One of the most notable achievements of Lofgren's career is her role as a leading voice in the fight against the SOPA and PIPA internet censorship bills. She introduced an alternative bill, the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade (OPEN) Act, which was designed to address piracy without compromising online freedom of expression. Her advocacy for online privacy and net neutrality has earned her widespread praise from tech industry leaders.

Lofgren is also an outspoken advocate for immigrant rights and has worked to reform the US immigration system. She was a sponsor of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act, which aimed to provide a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children. She has also been a vocal critic of the Trump administration's immigration policies, particularly the separation of families at the border.

On environmental issues, Lofgren has consistently voted in support of climate action. She has also advocated for stronger regulation of toxic chemicals and for the protection of public lands.

One of Lofgren's most notable quotes came in the wake of the 2016 presidential election when she stated, Democracy is not a spectator sport. It requires participation. It requires engagement. And it requires vigilance. Her commitment to democratic values and civic engagement has been a cornerstone of her career.

However, Lofgren has also faced controversy during her career. In 2008, she was implicated in the House banking scandal, where members of Congress had written numerous bad checks, often with taxpayer money, as the House Bank had no overdraft fees. While she was not accused of wrongdoing, the scandal led to a significant loss of public trust in Congress.

In terms of her current positions on major issues, Lofgren has been a strong supporter of healthcare reform and has advocated for expanding access to affordable healthcare. She has also supported legislation that would prevent workplace discrimination against LGBTQ+ individuals and has been an advocate for common-sense gun control measures.

Overall, Zoe Lofgren has established herself as a respected and dedicated public servant. While she has faced controversy in the past, her advocacy for civil liberties, immigration reform, and technology policy has earned her a loyal following among voters in her district and beyond.
