Kathy Castor is a Democratic Congresswoman who represents Florida's 14th Congressional District, which includes parts of Tampa and St. Petersburg. She was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006 and has since been re-elected for six consecutive terms. 

Born and raised in Tampa, Castor received her undergraduate degree from Emory University and her law degree from Florida State University. Before entering politics, she worked as an attorney and served as the President of the Hillsborough County Environmental Protection Commission.

Castor is known for being a vocal advocate for the environment, healthcare, and equal rights. She has consistently voted to protect and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, has worked to pass legislation to combat climate change, and has been an ally to the LGBTQ+ community. 

In terms of accomplishments, Castor helped secure over $2 billion in federal funding for a high-speed rail line between Tampa and Orlando, which would have created jobs and boosted the economy. However, the project was eventually cancelled due to opposition from Florida Governor Rick Scott.

Castor has also been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration, particularly on issues related to immigration and the environment. She has called for comprehensive immigration reform and has opposed the administration's efforts to roll back environmental protections.

On the other hand, Castor has faced criticism for her support of the controversial Keystone XL pipeline and for her initial support of the anti-piracy bills SOPA and PIPA. She later reversed her position on the bills, citing concerns about their potential impact on freedom of speech.

Despite these controversies, Castor has maintained a strong record of service to her constituents and has been praised for her dedication to her community. She has been recognized by the Sierra Club with the John Muir Award for her work on environmental issues and has received a score of 100% from the Human Rights Campaign for her support of LGBTQ+ rights.

In conclusion, Kathy Castor is a seasoned politician who has demonstrated a commitment to progressive values and a dedication to her constituents. She has a strong record of accomplishments and has been a vocal advocate for issues important to voters in her district. However, like all politicians, she has faced criticism and controversies, which voters will need to take into account when making their decisions in future elections.
