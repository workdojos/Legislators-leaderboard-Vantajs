Mike Turner is an American politician and attorney who has served as the U.S. Representative for Ohio's 10th congressional district since 2003. As a seasoned politician, Turner has been known to take strong stances on a range of issues, from national security to education reform.

Born in Dayton, Ohio in 1960, Turner graduated from Ohio Northern University with a degree in political science before earning a law degree from Case Western Reserve University. He began his political career as a council member in Dayton before serving as Mayor of Dayton from 1994 to 2002.

Since his election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2003, Turner has established himself as a reliable conservative voice in Congress. He has consistently advocated for pro-military policies, including increased defense spending and support for military families. In recognition of his work supporting military families, Turner was awarded the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service in 2019.

Turner has also been an outspoken advocate for small businesses, supporting efforts to reduce regulation and cut taxes. In 2017, he voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which he claimed would put Americans back to work and grow our economy. Critics of the bill argued that it primarily benefited wealthy individuals and large corporations.

On social issues, Turner has been a consistent opponent of abortion rights and same-sex marriage. He has a 100% rating from the National Right to Life Committee and has voted in favor of legislation to defund Planned Parenthood, restrict access to abortion, and protect religious freedom.

In recent years, Turner has been embroiled in controversy over his personal life. In 2015, he admitted to having an extramarital affair with a lobbyist. His ex-wife also accused him of physical and emotional abuse during their marriage. Turner has denied the abuse allegations, but the scandal has damaged his personal and political reputation.

Despite the controversy surrounding his personal life, Turner has maintained a strong following among conservative voters in Ohio's 10th congressional district. In 2020, he was re-elected to his ninth term in Congress with over 60% of the vote.
