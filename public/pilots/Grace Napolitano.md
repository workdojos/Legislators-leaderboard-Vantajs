Grace Napolitano is an American politician who serves as the U.S. Representative for California's 32nd congressional district. Born in Brownsville, Texas, on December 4, 1936, Napolitano has been a prominent figure in California politics for over 20 years, having been elected to Congress in 1998.

One of Napolitano's most notable achievements is her leadership in securing funding for water infrastructure projects in California. In her tenure, Napolitano has secured over $1 billion in funding for local water infrastructure projects, helping to ensure that California has access to safe and reliable water resources.

In addition to her work on water issues, Napolitano has been a strong advocate for mental health and has been instrumental in securing funding for mental health programs in California. In 2013, she introduced a bill to establish a national suicide prevention hotline, which was passed and signed into law in 2020.

However, Napolitano's record has not been without controversy. In 2010, she was fined $5,000 by the Federal Election Commission for failing to report almost $400,000 in donations to her campaign. In 2018, she was accused of creating a hostile work environment for her staff, which led to turnover in her office.

On the issues, Napolitano is a strong supporter of Medicare and has advocated for expanding access to healthcare for all Americans. She supports a woman's right to choose and has been a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights. She has also been a strong supporter of environmental protections, voting to protect California's coast from offshore drilling and advocating for investment in renewable energy.

One interesting tidbit about Napolitano is that she is the only member of Congress to have been both a local mayor (Norwalk, California) and a member of the California State Assembly before being elected to Congress.

In conclusion, while Napolitano's record has had its share of controversy, her achievements in securing funding for critical water infrastructure projects and advocacy for mental health cannot be ignored. Her stances on healthcare, reproductive rights, LGBTQ+ rights, and the environment make her a powerful force in California politics. Whether or not she runs for reelection, Napolitano's legacy in Congress is sure to leave a lasting impact.
