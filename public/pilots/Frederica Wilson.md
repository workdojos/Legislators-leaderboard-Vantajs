Frederica Wilson is a woman of many firsts. She is the first African American woman to serve on the Miami-Dade County School Board and the first African American to represent Florida's 24th Congressional District. She is known for her passionate advocacy for civil rights and education reform, as well as her colorful and iconic hats.

One of Wilson's key achievements is her leadership in advocating for the recognition of the contributions of African American women in the military.

However, Wilson has also been at the center of controversies. In 2017, she became embroiled in a public spat with President Donald Trump over his treatment of a widow of a soldier killed in Niger. Wilson accused the president of being insensitive, while the president accused her of lying and using the incident for political gain.

In terms of policy positions, Wilson is a strong supporter of education reform and has worked to secure federal funding for schools in her district. She has also been vocal on issues related to gun violence, immigration reform, and civil rights.
