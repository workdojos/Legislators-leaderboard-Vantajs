Pat Ryan is a former Army Officer and business technology entrepreneur who is running for Congress in New York's 19th Congressional District.

Ryan served in the U.S. Army from 2002-2008, including two tours in Iraq as an intelligence officer where he earned a Bronze Star for his service. After leaving the military, Ryan founded two technology companies in the Hudson Valley that provide jobs for the local community.

Ryan has been vocal on issues such as healthcare, education, and the environment. He supports expanding access to healthcare and reducing the cost of prescription drugs, ensuring students have access to quality education, and combating the effects of climate change.

In an interview with Hudson Valley One, Ryan stated, Climate change is real, it's happening now, and it's the greatest threat facing humanity in our lifetimes. We need to acknowledge that, and we need to take action to address it.

Ryan's campaign has garnered attention for its grassroots approach, with over 1,500 people volunteering to help. According to the latest filings with the Federal Election Commission, Ryan's campaign has raised over $1 million dollars, with 92% of donations coming from individuals.

However, Ryan has faced controversy over his past support for the National Rifle Association (NRA). In a statement released in 2018, Ryan expressed regret for his past association with the NRA and pledged to support common-sense gun safety measures.

Overall, Pat Ryan's background as a military veteran and entrepreneur, his focus on healthcare, education, and the environment, and his grassroots campaign approach make him a compelling candidate for voters in New York's 19th Congressional District.
