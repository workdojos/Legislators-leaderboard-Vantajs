Mike Bost is a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives, representing Illinois's 12th congressional district since 2015. He is a seasoned politician, having previously served in the Illinois House of Representatives and as a county board member.

One of Bost's notable achievements is his work on the VA Accountability Act, which was signed into law in 2018. This legislation makes it easier for the Department of Veterans Affairs to fire employees who are not fulfilling their duties and provides better protections for whistleblowers. Bost has been a strong advocate for veterans throughout his career, and this bill is just one example of his dedication to their well-being.

Bost has also been a strong advocate for fiscal responsibility in Congress. He has consistently voted for bills that reduce government spending and balance the budget. This aligns with his belief in smaller government and lower taxes.

On the social issues front, Bost is a pro-life advocate and has received endorsements from several pro-life organizations. He also supports the Second Amendment and has received endorsements from gun rights groups.

However, Bost has faced some controversy in his political career. In 2018, he faced criticism for his reaction to protesters who were disrupting a House vote on immigration. Bost became visibly angry and shouted at the protesters, earning him a viral moment on social media.

In terms of his views on major issues, Bost supports repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (ACA). He has voted in favor of several bills that aim to dismantle the ACA, arguing that it has raised healthcare costs and reduced patient choice.

Bost's stance on immigration is consistent with the Republican party platform. He supports strengthening border security and cracking down on illegal immigration. He has voted for bills that would fund the construction of a border wall and end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

In conclusion, Mike Bost is a seasoned politician with a track record of advocating for veterans and fiscal responsibility. While he has faced some controversy in his career, his achievements in Congress speak to his dedication to the issues he cares about. His views align with the Republican party on major issues such as healthcare and immigration. For voters who prioritize these issues, Bost is a candidate worth considering in future elections.
