Meet Pete Stauber- a former professional hockey player, retired police officer, and current member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing Minnesota's 8th congressional district since 2019.

Stauber's early life in Minnesota was characterized by his passion for hockey. He played in the 1984 and 1986 Olympic games, winning a silver medal in the latter. After retiring from hockey, Stauber returned to Duluth, Minnesota and joined the Duluth Police Department, where he served for over 20 years.

In 2018, Stauber announced his candidacy for the House of Representatives and won the election in November of that year. During his time in Congress, Stauber has focused on issues such as small business support, infrastructure development, and healthcare reform. He has also been a strong advocate for the mining industry in his district, which he sees as central to the economic wellbeing of his constituents.

Stauber has been vocal about his support for the Second Amendment and has opposed gun control measures proposed by Democrats in the House, citing concerns about the infringement on the rights of law-abiding gun owners. He has also been a staunch supporter of President Trump's immigration policies and has praised the administration's efforts to secure the Southern border.

While Stauber has been a vocal advocate for his views, he has also been willing to reach across the aisle to work with Democrats on common-sense solutions for his district. For example, he has worked with Rep. Angie Craig, a Democrat from Minnesota, to support rural broadband development and advance legislation to protect the Boundary Waters wilderness area.

However, Stauber has also faced criticism from some who see his positions as too extreme and uncompromising. He has been called out for dismissive remarks about the Black Lives Matter movement and has advocated for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act without a clear plan for a replacement.

Overall, Pete Stauber remains a popular figure among many of his constituents, known for his strong work ethic, dedication to his community, and willingness to take on tough issues. Whether you agree or disagree with his views, there is no denying the impact that Stauber has had on his district and on Congress as a whole.
