Patrick McHenry is a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina's 10th congressional district. He was first elected to Congress in 2004 and has since been re-elected seven times.

One of McHenry's most notable achievements was his role in the passage of the JOBS Act, which President Obama signed into law in 2012. The act aimed to make it easier for small businesses to raise capital and go public, and it is estimated to have created more than 100,000 jobs.

McHenry is also a member of the House Financial Services Committee, where he has advocated for reducing government regulations on businesses and financial institutions. He has been a vocal opponent of the Dodd-Frank Act, which he believes has stifled economic growth and harmed small businesses.

In terms of controversies, McHenry has faced criticism for his ties to payday lenders, who have donated to his campaigns and whom he has defended from increased regulation. Some have accused him of prioritizing the interests of these companies over the interests of his constituents.

On major issues, McHenry is a staunch conservative and has consistently voted in favor of pro-life policies, Second Amendment rights, and a smaller federal government. He has also been a vocal supporter of President Trump and his agenda.

Some memorable quotes from McHenry include:

- Capitalism isn't perfect, but it's better than anything else out there.
- People don't want a bigger government. They want a government that works better for them.
- Conservatism is not about winning an argument, it's about winning hearts and minds.
- When we empower individuals, we change cultures.

In the upcoming election, McHenry's stance on issues such as healthcare, immigration, and the economy will likely be of interest to voters. Regardless of one's political views, it is clear that McHenry is a seasoned politician with a track record of advocating for his beliefs and achieving results in Congress.
