Morgan Luttrell is a former Navy SEAL and now-politician whose life story is nothing short of inspiring. He spent eight years serving his country as part of the elite special forces unit, and his experiences have shaped his political views and values as a candidate.

Luttrell's family has a history of military service, with his twin brother, Marcus Luttrell, also a former Navy SEAL and best-selling author of Lone Survivor. Morgan's devotion to his country is demonstrated in his career as a SEAL where he was awarded the Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his service in the War on Terror.

After leaving the military, Luttrell ran for and was elected to the Texas House of Representatives in 2018, representing District 125. During his time in office, he has been a vocal advocate for veterans' rights, education, and law enforcement.

Luttrell's platform includes strengthening border security, improving access to healthcare for veterans, and promoting economic growth through reduced regulations and tax incentives for small businesses.

However, his time in office has not been without controversy. In 2019, Luttrell was accused of sexual harassment by a former staffer, leading to an investigation by the Texas House Administration Committee. The investigation ultimately found insufficient evidence of wrongdoing by Luttrell.

Critics have also questioned Luttrell's stance on gun control, as he has been a vocal opponent of any type of restriction on Second Amendment rights. He opposed the universal background check bill that was brought before the Texas Legislature in 2019.

Despite these controversies, Morgan Luttrell's unwavering dedication to public service and his impressive military record have earned him widespread respect and support amongst his constituents. As he looks to continue his career in politics, it will be interesting to see how he will tackle the important issues facing Texas and the United States as a whole.
