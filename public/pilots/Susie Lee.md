Susie Lee is a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives representing Nevada's 3rd congressional district. She was first elected in 2018, and she currently serves on the Committees on Education and Labor and Veterans' Affairs.

Before being elected to Congress, Susie Lee established the non-profit organization Communities In Schools of Nevada, which helped more than 64,000 at-risk students in 63 schools receive the support they needed to stay in school and graduate. She has also served on the boards of many prominent organizations, including The Smith Center for the Performing Arts and the Womenâ€™s Research Institute of Nevada.

In Congress, Lee has focused on issues such as veterans' affairs, education, and healthcare. She has introduced several bills to improve access to healthcare, including the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, which would give Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices.

Lee has also been a vocal advocate of protecting the rights of DACA recipients. In a speech on the House floor, she said, To the 13,000 DACA recipients in the state of Nevada, I want you to know that I see you, I hear you, and I stand with you. You are our friends, our neighbors, and our community leaders. You deserve better than to live in fear and uncertainty.

Regarding gun control, Lee has advocated for background checks on all firearm purchases and has co-sponsored legislation to prevent those convicted of hate crimes from purchasing firearms.

However, Lee has also faced criticism for her connections to wealthy donors. During her 2018 campaign, she received tens of thousands of dollars from the pharmaceutical industry and faced backlash for voting to repeal an Obama-era regulation that would have made it easier for patients to sue nursing homes for neglect or abuse.

In conclusion, Susie Lee is a respected member of Congress known for her community work and advocacy for healthcare reform, education, and veterans' affairs. While she has faced criticism for her ties to wealthy donors, she has also been instrumental in advocating for marginalized communities and gun control reform. Ultimately, voters will have to weigh the pros and cons of Lee's record to decide if she is the right candidate for them.
