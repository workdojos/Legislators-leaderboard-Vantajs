Young Kim is a Korean-American politician who served in the California State Assembly from 2014 to 2016, representing the 65th Assembly District. She is now running for Congress in California's 39th congressional district, hoping to become the first Korean-American woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.

Before entering politics, Kim worked as a small business owner and served as an aide to longtime Republican Congressman Ed Royce. She has been recognized for her commitment to public service and received numerous awards, including the Business and Professional Women of Fullerton's Woman of Distinction Award.

Kim's platform centers around several key issues, such as job creation, protecting small businesses, and improving education. She supports lowering taxes for small businesses, increasing funding for vocational education, and expanding access to affordable healthcare. She has also been vocal about her opposition to illegal immigration and supports President Trump's efforts to secure the border.

Despite her impressive resume, Kim's candidacy has not been without controversy. In a recent interview with the Los Angeles Times, she faced criticism for not taking a clear stance on the issue of gun control. Kim stated, I don't believe that taking someone's Second Amendment right away is the way to go, but at the same time, we need to make sure that people who have mental issues or those who are a danger to society aren't able to have access to guns. Her ambiguous position on this issue has drawn criticism from some voters, while others believe it is a sign of her willingness to listen to all sides of an issue and find common ground.

Kim's candidacy has garnered attention from both sides of the aisle, with former Vice President Joe Biden endorsing her opponent, while Senator Lindsey Graham has publicly praised her campaign. Her ability to appeal to a broad base of voters and her commitment to public service make her a formidable candidate in the race for California's 39th congressional district.

In the words of Young Kim herself, I truly believe that political leaders should work with their constituents to find solutions to the issues that matter most to them. As a community leader and small business owner, I understand what it takes to get things done. If elected, I promise to put the needs of my constituents first and work hard every day to make our community a better place for all.
