Nicole Malliotakis is a Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives representing New York's 11th Congressional District. She was first elected in 2020, defeating the incumbent Democrat Max Rose.

Malliotakis served in the New York State Assembly from 2011 to 2020, where she was a member of the Ways and Means Committee and served as ranking member of the Governmental Operations Committee. During her time in the Assembly, Malliotakis advocated for fiscal responsibility and tax cuts while also supporting efforts to combat domestic violence and human trafficking.

One of Malliotakis' most notable achievements was spearheading the effort to repeal the MTA payroll tax, which saved New York City businesses $320 million a year. She also fought against efforts to raise tolls on bridges and tunnels, which she argued would unfairly burden middle-class families and small businesses.

On the national level, Malliotakis has been a vocal supporter of President Donald Trump and has endorsed many of his policies, including the tax cuts passed in 2017 and the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. She has also been a strong advocate for increased border security and immigration reform, arguing that these issues are critical to national security.

However, Malliotakis has not been without controversy. In 2017, she was criticized for accepting campaign contributions from a group linked to a white supremacist and for her association with far-right groups such as the Proud Boys. She has denied any association with white supremacist groups and has condemned the actions of the Proud Boys.

Malliotakis has been quoted as saying, I believe in limited government, free enterprise, and personal responsibility. I don't think government should be telling us what to do in our personal lives or how to run our businesses.

Overall, Malliotakis' track record in the New York State Assembly and her support for conservative policies may appeal to voters who prioritize fiscal responsibility and limited government. However, her association with extremist groups and controversial campaign contributions may be a turnoff for some voters.
