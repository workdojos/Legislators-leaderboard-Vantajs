Adriano Espaillat is a Dominican American politician who currently serves as the U.S. Representative for New York's 13th congressional district. Born on September 27, 1954, in the Dominican Republic, Espaillat has become a significant figure in New York politics over the past few decades.

Espaillat began his political career in the New York State Assembly, where he served from 1997 to 2010. In 2010, he was elected to the New York State Senate, where he served until 2016, when he was elected to the United States House of Representatives.

During his time in office, Espaillat has been a strong advocate for affordable housing, healthcare, and education reform. He has also been an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump's immigration policies and has been a vocal supporter of immigrant rights.

One of Espaillat's most significant achievements in Congress came when he introduced the Dream and Promise Act in 2019, which would provide a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants who came to this country as children. The bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives but was blocked in the Senate.

Espaillat has also been outspoken about the need for police reform in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in 2020. He has called for a ban on chokeholds and has proposed legislation that would establish a national standard for the use of force by law enforcement officers.

However, Espaillat has faced some controversy during his time in office. In 2017, it was reported that he owed over $50,000 in back rent on a luxury apartment in New York City. He eventually paid off the debt but faced criticism for not practicing what he preached when it comes to affordable housing.

Despite the controversy, Espaillat remains popular among his constituents and has continued to be a voice for marginalized communities in Congress. In his own words, We believe in justice and equality for all, no matter your race, your religion, your gender, or your nationality.
