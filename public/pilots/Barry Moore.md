Barry Moore is a Republican congressman from Alabama's second congressional district. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 2020 after defeating his Democratic opponent by a comfortable 20-point margin.

Before entering politics, Moore served in the U.S. Army Reserve and National Guard for over two decades, eventually retiring as a lieutenant colonel. He then went on to create multiple successful small businesses, including a waste management company and a construction firm.

Throughout his first term in Congress, Moore has been a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump, earning a 90% loyalty rating from Trump's political action committee, Save America PAC. He has espoused conservative views on a range of issues, including gun rights, immigration, and opposition to abortion.

Moore has also introduced several bills during his time in Congress, including the Granting Release and Compassion Effectively (GRACE) Act, which would provide compassionate release to nonviolent, elderly offenders who have completed at least two-thirds of their prison sentence.

However, Moore has also faced controversy during his short time in office. He was one of several Republican lawmakers who voted against certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, citing concerns over voter fraud. Additionally, he recently made headlines for comparing vaccine mandates to the Holocaust, sparking backlash from both sides of the political aisle.

Despite these controversies, Moore remains a popular figure among Alabama's conservative base. As he gears up for his 2022 re-election campaign, it will be interesting to see how these issues and achievements play out in the eyes of voters.
