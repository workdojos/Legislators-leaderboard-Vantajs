Yadira Caraveo is a physician, a mother, and a state representative for Colorado's House District 31. Elected in 2018, Caraveo became the first physician to serve in the state legislature in over 50 years. 

Before delving into Caraveo's political career, it's worth noting her impressive background in medicine. She received her medical degree from the University of Colorado, and completed her residency at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center. She's not only a board-certified pediatrician, but also a specialist in adolescent medicine and a volunteer medical director for a community health center. Prior to her political career, Caraveo founded a nonprofit organization focused on providing healthcare to underserved populations in Colorado. 

When Caraveo announced her candidacy for state representative, she stated that she wanted to bring a science-based approach to the political arena. I believe that policy and politics should be more informed by data, research, and facts, Caraveo said, according to the Colorado Independent. I want to bring those things to the forefront of Colorado's policy-making process.

Throughout her tenure as state representative, Caraveo has focused on healthcare, education, and the environment. In her first year in office, she was the primary sponsor of a bill that aimed to decrease prescription drug costs in Colorado by creating a price cap based on what other countries pay for the same drugs. The bill ultimately failed, but it garnered national attention and sparked conversations about healthcare affordability. 

Caraveo also supported a state law that requires schools to teach comprehensive sex education, including topics like consent, healthy relationships, and LGBTQ+ inclusivity. She has also been a vocal advocate for environmental protections, sponsoring bills that would increase renewable energy use and reduce carbon emissions. 

While Caraveo has been praised for her medical expertise and dedication to her constituents, there have also been some controversies during her time in office. In 2021, she made headlines for co-sponsoring a bill that would give Colorado the ability to impose fines on individuals who violate mask mandates during a public health emergency. The bill was met with backlash from some constituents who saw it as government overreach. 

Despite the controversies surrounding her, Caraveo has made a name for herself in Colorado politics as a thoughtful and passionate representative. As she told the Colorado Independent in 2018, I've always been driven by values and doing what's right. 

Here are a few notable quotes from Caraveo:

- I'm not here to play political games or further a political agenda. I'm here to represent the people of District 31 and do what's best for them.
- Science should be a bipartisan issue. It shouldn't be about politics. It's about what's true and what's real.
- I'm proud to be the voice of the medical community in the legislature. I think it's important to have a healthcare perspective when making policy decisions.
