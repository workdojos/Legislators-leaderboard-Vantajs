Hillary Scholten is an American politician and lawyer from Michigan who currently serves as a Democratic candidate for the US House of Representatives in the state's third district. Here are some facts and figures that are worth noting about her:

- Scholten is a graduate of Calvin University and obtained her law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law.
- She previously served as an attorney for the Department of Justice, where she worked to protect children from abuse and neglect and prosecute human traffickers.
- As a candidate, Scholten has emphasized her support for expanding access to healthcare, addressing the climate crisis, and promoting economic growth and equality.
- She has also advocated for criminal justice reform, including reducing mandatory minimum sentences and ending the cash bail system.
- In her campaign, Scholten has earned high-profile endorsements from Senator Bernie Sanders and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
- Scholten is running against incumbent Republican Representative Peter Meijer, who was elected in 2020 after the retirement of longtime Congressman Justin Amash.
- Scholten has criticized Meijer for his opposition to the Affordable Care Act and his support for tax cuts that primarily benefit wealthy individuals and corporations.
- She has also highlighted Meijer's vote against certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election, which she argues shows a lack of respect for democratic norms and the rule of law.

In addition to her policy positions, Scholten's personal story has also been a source of inspiration for many of her supporters. For example, she has spoken openly about her experiences growing up in a family impacted by poverty and addiction, and how those experiences shaped her dedication to social justice and advocacy for marginalized communities.

Scholten's campaign is an important one to watch in the upcoming elections, as it will likely be seen as a test of Democrats' ability to compete in traditionally Republican-leaning districts. Whether or not she ultimately wins, Scholten's candidacy is a reminder of the importance of principled and committed individuals stepping up to serve their communities and fight for the values they believe in.
