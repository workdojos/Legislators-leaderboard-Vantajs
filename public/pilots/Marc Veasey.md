Marc Veasey is a United States Congressman who was first elected in 2012 from Texas's 33rd congressional district. Throughout his time in office, he has been known for his commitment to promoting economic growth, job creation, and social justice.

One of Veasey's major legislative accomplishments was helping to pass the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in 2010. He supported the ACA, which extended health coverage to millions of Americans who previously lacked access to healthcare. Veasey also supports healthcare reform that would lower costs for individuals and expand access to healthcare services.

Veasey is known for his support for labor unions, advocating for worker's rights, and focusing on creating jobs in his district. The congressman has pushed for infrastructure initiatives that would create jobs and expand economic opportunities in his district. He has also worked to secure federal grants for local communities and advocated for federal investment in job training programs.

Veasey has been a strong advocate for immigration reform and was a vocal critic of the Trump administration's family separation policy, which separated thousands of children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. He has called for comprehensive immigration reform that would protect Dreamers and provide a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living in the U.S.

On the issue of climate change, Veasey has voiced his support for policies that would address this pressing issue. He has argued for reducing the U.S.'s carbon footprint and promoting the use of renewable energy sources.

In 2019, Veasey introduced the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels or NOPEC bill, which would hold countries accountable for manipulating oil prices for their own gain. The measure would allow the U.S. government to sue OPEC and other countries that coordinate to manipulate oil prices.

However, Veasey has come under criticism for accepting donations from corporate PACs, including those that represent the fossil fuel industry. Some have argued that this acceptance of corporate donations may influence his positions on important issues, including climate change.

Overall, Marc Veasey's commitment to promoting economic growth, expanding access to healthcare, and advocating for social justice sets him apart as a strong and dedicated representative for Texas's 33rd congressional district.
