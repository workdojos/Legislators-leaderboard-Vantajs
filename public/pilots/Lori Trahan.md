Lori Trahan is the current U.S. Representative for Massachusetts' 3rd congressional district, serving since the 2019 elections. Before being elected to Congress, Trahan had an impressive career in politics as an aide for former Congressman Marty Meehan and as an advocate for the reduction of health disparities.

Throughout her short time in Congress, Trahan has made her mark with her focus on education, healthcare, and climate change. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Trahan helped pass the CARES Act, which provided economic relief to millions of Americans and small businesses.

However, Trahan has faced controversy in her brief tenure as a member of Congress. She was accused of using campaign funds to repay a personal loan from her husband's bank account, which she denies. The issue was investigated and ultimately dismissed by the Federal Election Commission.

Despite the controversy, Trahan remains a popular figure amongst her constituents in Massachusetts. She is known for being a committed and effective representative for the state, as evidenced by her impressive list of endorsements from community organizations, labor unions, and progressive groups.
