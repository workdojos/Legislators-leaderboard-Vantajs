Troy Nehls has been a prominent public servant in Texas for several years, serving as sheriff in Fort Bend County before being elected to Congress in 2020.

During his time as sheriff, Nehls worked to reduce the crime rate in Fort Bend County, one of the fastest-growing counties in the nation. He implemented innovative policies like a mental health screening program for inmates and a mobile app that allowed residents to report crimes and submit tips anonymously.

Nehls has also been a vocal advocate for law enforcement, stating in a recent interview that he believes police officers are the most noble profession there is. He has been critical of efforts to defund the police and has called for stronger support for law enforcement agencies.

On a national level, Nehls has expressed support for President Trump's policies, particularly on immigration and border security. He has called for tougher border enforcement and has been a vocal opponent of sanctuary cities.

One potential controversy that may arise for Nehls is his deeply conservative voting record. Nehls has aligned himself closely with the Republican party and has been a consistent supporter of socially conservative policies. This could make him a divisive figure among voters who hold more progressive views.

Despite this, Nehls has already achieved a number of successes in his brief time in Congress. He has secured federal funding for infrastructure projects in his district and has been working to support small businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

As Nehls continues to serve in Congress and potentially seeks higher office in the future, voters can expect him to prioritize issues related to border security, law enforcement, and economic growth.
