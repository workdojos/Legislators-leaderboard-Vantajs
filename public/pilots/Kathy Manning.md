Kathy Manning is a prominent figure in American politics, having served as a former diplomat and businesswoman. She is now a member of the US House of Representatives from North Carolina's 6th district.

Born in Detroit, Michigan, Kathy Manning went on to receive her law degree from the University of Michigan. After graduation, she moved to Washington, DC, to work for the U.S. Department of Justice. She then worked as a litigator for several high-profile law firms before becoming a partner at a law firm based in Greensboro, North Carolina.

In addition to her legal career, Manning also served as a diplomat under President Barack Obama, working on economic development and entrepreneurship initiatives in Jerusalem. She also served as the Chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party from 2009 to 2013.

Since taking office in 2019, Manning has been a vocal advocate for affordable healthcare, voting rights, and climate change action. She is a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and has actively worked to promote democracy and human rights around the world.

Manning has also been a strong supporter of small businesses and has worked to ensure that they have access to much-needed resources and funding. She has sponsored several bills aimed at supporting small businesses, including the Small Business Lending Fairness Act and the Main Street Employee Ownership Act.

However, Manning has also faced controversy over her support for certain policies. She has been criticized for her support of a bill that would have allowed pensions to invest in private equity funds, which some argue puts workers' retirement savings at risk.

Despite controversy, Manning continues to enjoy widespread support in her district and has been praised for her dedication to public service. In the words of former President Barack Obama, Kathy Manning has spent her career fighting for fairness and opportunity, and we need more leaders like her in Congress.

As the 2022 midterm elections draw near, voters will undoubtedly be paying close attention to where Kathy Manning stands on important issues such as healthcare, small business, and foreign policy. One thing is for certain â€“ Manning will bring her vast experience and commitment to public service to the table, no matter what the future may hold.
